Mass adoption of AVs might have both positive and negative impacts to travel demand and the transportation system. How we adopt, matters. Several studies show that private AVs might lead to more travel demand and dispersed urban patterns, but shared AVs might contribute otherwise. This paper presents an overview of and a modelling work on a dataset collected in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to understand consumers' willingness-to-pay for various automation levels in their vehicles simultaneously with private and shared ownership types. The study used 190 records from a reasonably representative sample collected from the study area. Heteroskedastic error-component mixed multinomial and nested logit models are formatted for different vehicle ownerships in this study. Strong inertia effect of staying with private conventional vehicles (PCVs) is identified. We also discover that private vehicle buyers will find level 4 vehicles attractive, whereas car-sharing service users will favour level 5 vehicles. For level 4 vehicles, consumers are willing to pay from CAN $ 10,800 to CAN $ 29,800, depending on the vehicle price. We also find that respondents' age, family members' health conditions, commuting conditionals, and household incomes will influence their willingness to pay for owning AVs.","[Wang, Kaili; Salehin, Mohammad Faizus; Habib, Khandker Nurul] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada","Wang, KL (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",jackkaili.wang@mail.utoronto.ca; mf.salehin@mail.utoronto.ca; khandker.nurulhabib@utoronto.ca,,,NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The analysis is based upon a survey-experiment conducted on one of the world's largest online language learning platforms. Drawing on theories of media globalization, cosmopolitanism and language ideologies, the study explores the factors that drive participation in online language learning and the attributes students favor in teacher selection. The results suggest that student preferences are closely related to learning motivations and media consumption. Specifically, 'pop cosmopolitan' students are far more likely to favor native speakers than students who are motivated by more mundane instrumental goals (such as career advancement). We attribute these findings to enduring perceptions about native speakers as more authentic representations of a particular language and culture. The implications of these findings for theories of pop cosmopolitanism and online language learning are discussed.","[Curran, Nathaniel Ming] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept English & Commun, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhen, Lichen; Galperin, Hernan] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA","Curran, NM (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hunghom Kowloon, Room AG410,Chung Sze Yuen Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",nate-ming.curran@polyu.edu.hk,,,2020 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2020-R21]; USC-SJTU Institute of Cultural and Creative Industry,This publication was supported by the 2020 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2020-R21) and a grant from the USC-SJTU Institute of Cultural and Creative Industry.,,66,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using a choice experiment, we simulate a decision process among refugees in Germany and examine the determinants of investment preferences into host country-specific credentials, such as vocational education, as an alternative to an immediately available job offer. The choice experiment was introduced in the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees, a representative longitudinal survey of recently arrived refugees in Germany. We find that refugees & rsquo; intentions of investing in vocational education are guided by the transferability of foreign human capital, the time horizon to reap investments, and rational cost & ndash;benefit calculations.

In different countries worldwide it has been shown that one way consumers want to support the energy transition is by switching to green electricity. However, few people make the leap from their intention to a buying decision. This study explores parameters that influence whether German consumers would hypothetically decide to switch to a green electricity tariff. Methods A quota-representative online survey including a discrete choice experiment with 371 German private households was conducted in 2016. For the econometric analysis, a generalized multinomial logit model in willingness-to-pay space was employed, enabling the estimation of WTP values to be as realistic as possible. Results The results show that consumers' decision whether or not to make the switch to green energy is mainly influenced by the source of green energy, whether a person can outsource the switching process, and a person's attitude towards the renewable energy sources levy that currently exist in Germany. Conclusions The findings indicate that politics should focus on supporting wind and solar energy as German consumers prefer these sources over biogas. As the results suggest, the EEG levy is a reason why consumers have lower WTP for switching to a green tariff. Therefore, a switching bonus with a specifically framed bonus in the amount of the current EEG levy could be a promising strategy for the increase of green energy tariff acceptance. Furthermore, attention should be given to psychological and behavioral aspects, as the results indicate that these factors influence the consumer's choice for a green electricity tariff.","[Danne, M.; Meier-Sauthoff, S.; Musshoff, O.] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Danne, M (corresponding author), Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",michael.danne@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,85,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2192-0567,,,ENERGY SUSTAIN SOC,Energy Sustain.

OBJECTIVE To determine the monetary value of surgical KC treatments, as perceived by society, as a measure of preference. PARTICIPANTS, METHODS AND MATERIALS We performed an internet-based age-, sex-, and race-stratified cross-sectional survey of 425 subjects representative of the US general population. Stated WTP and desirability of electrodesiccation and curettage (EDC), excision, and Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) for facial and extrafacial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) were assessed. A discrete choice experiment was performed using maximum likelihood estimation, and a secondary analysis was performed to determine the influence of framing MMS as the best treatment option. RESULTS A total of 425 subjects finished their questionnaires, yielding a completion rate of 97%. Median (interquartile range) stated WTP for EDC, excision, and MMS were $1,000 (421-2,079), $1,503 (562-3,062), and $3,006 (1,250-5,084), respectively, when MMS was framed in a standard fashion. Stated WTP for MMS increased to $3,989 (2,015-5,801) when it was framed as the best option. For BCC on the back, WTP for MMS dropped by 12%. CONCLUSION There is markedly higher societal WTP for MMS on both the face and trunk, regardless of whether MMS is framed as the best option. Gold-standard bias may affect WTP and desirability in medical decision-making under uncertainty, inflating the WTP of options framed as the best while decreasing the desirability of alternatives.","[Kantor, Jonathan] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Dept Dermatol,Ctr Global Hlth, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kantor, Jonathan] Florida Ctr Dermatol PA, POB 3044, St Augustine, FL 32085 USA","Kantor, J (corresponding author), Florida Ctr Dermatol PA, POB 3044, St Augustine, FL 32085 USA.",jonkantor@gmail.com,,,,,,49,1,1,1,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1076-0512,1524-4725,,DERMATOL SURG,Dermatol.

This study explores how the presentation of fuel economy information can influence valuation using a stated choice experiment with comparative experimental conditions. We randomly assigned a nationally representative sample of 1,612 intended vehicle purchasers in the United States to one of six conditions, which varied in their presentation of fuel economy information as follows: miles per gallon, annual fuel costs, five-year fuel cost, lifetime fuel cost, amount of money saved/spent over five years compared to the average vehicle per class, and the full government-mandated fuel economy label (in the US). We find that consumer valuation of fuel economy is causally impacted by the information presented. In particular, we observe significantly higher willingness-to-pay values for participants in the condition with the full fuel economy label, relative to conditions only presented with the annual fuel cost, five-year fuel cost, and spend/save comparison. Valuation also varied with the demographic characteristics of participants: fuel economy was more highly valued among older participants and those that anticipated a relatively lower purchase price for their next vehicle. This study suggests that the observed inconsistencies in consumer valuation of fuel economy in the literature may stem in part from differences in the framing of fuel economy information across studies - at least for stated preference studies.","[Long, Zoe; Axsen, Jonn] Simon Fraser Univ, Sustainable Transportat Act Res Team, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Kormos, Christine] Kormos Consulting, 401-2272 Dundas St, Vancouver, BC V5L 1J8, Canada; [Sussman, Reuven] Amer Council Energy Efficient Econ, 529 14 St NW,Suite 600, Washington, DC USA","Long, Z (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sustainable Transportat Act Res Team, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",zoe_long@sfu.ca,,,American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Consumer Reports,"This study was made possible through the generous support of Consumer Reports as well as financial contribution from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

In times of scarcity, patient prioritization based on non-medical considerations might be necessary. Objective The aim of this study was to pilot test a survey to elicit public opinions on the relative importance of non-medical considerations in priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU in times of crisis. Methods A discrete-choice experiment was used to collect social preferences for priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. The six attributes were patient age, profession, guardianship, risk-conscious behavior on a societal level, health-conscious behavior, and expected ICU length of stay. The data were analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit model. Interactions between the age and profession of the respondents and the age and profession of the patient profiles were considered. Results The mean (+/- standard deviation) age of respondents was 35.9 +/- 14.5 years. In all, 70% of respondents indicated that medical and/or non-medical considerations should play a role in prioritizing patients for the ICU, whereas 15% agreed with a first come, first served strategy and the remaining 15% had no opinion. Respondents deemed risk-conscious behavior on a societal level to be the most important non-medical factor that should be used to prioritize patients in phase three of the framework, garnering an attribute importance (AI) of 31.2%, followed by patient age (AI 16.3%) and health-conscious behavior (AI 16.0%). ICU length of stay had the lowest impact on patient prioritization for ICU admittance (AI 10.9%). Younger and older respondents attached more importance to age than respondents in the middle age group and indicated a stronger preference to prioritize patients in their own age group (p = 0.042). Conclusion The results of our study demonstrate the relative importance members of the public attach to responsible societal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the next phase of the study, we will elicit the perspectives of a representative sample of the Dutch population. Changes to the task design and attribute operationalization could improve the external validity of the study findings, and optimization of the experimental design will improve the internal validity of the study.","[Gijsbers, Merle; Keizer, Iris Elise; Schouten, Stephanie Else; Trompert, Janneke Louise] Univ Twente, Educ Program Hlth Sci Sci & Technol, Enschede, Netherlands; [Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G.

While control measures, such as quarantine, lockdown and social distancing, reduce infections and infection-related deaths, they have severe negative economic and social consequences. Objectives The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability of different infectious disease control measures, and examine how respondents trade off between economic and health outcomes. Methods A discrete choice experiment was developed, with attributes covering: control restrictions, duration of restrictions, tracking, number of infections and of deaths, unemployment, government expenditure and additional personal tax. A representative sample of Australians (n = 1046) completed the survey, which included eight choice tasks. Data were analysed using mixed logit regression to identify heterogeneity and latent class models to examine heterogeneity. Results In general, respondents had strong preferences for policies that avoided high infection-related deaths, although lower unemployment and government expenditure were also considered important. Respondents preferred a shorter duration for restrictions, but their preferences did not vary significantly for the differing levels of control measures. In terms of tracking, respondents preferred mobile phone tracking or bracelets when compared to no tracking. Significant differences in preferences was identified, with two distinct classes: Class 1 (57%) preferred the economy to remain open with some control measures, whereas Class 2 (43%), had stronger preferences for policies that reduced avoidable deaths. Conclusions This study found that the Australian population is willing to relinquish some freedom, in the short term, and trade off the negative social and economic impacts of the pandemic, to avoid the negative health consequences.","[Manipis, Kathleen; Street, Deborah; Cronin, Paula; Viney, Rosalie; Goodall, Stephen] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Manipis, K (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",kathleen.manipis@chere.uts.edu.au,,"Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635; Manipis, Kathleen/0000-0002-7159-0912",Australian Government Research Training ProgramAustralian Government,This work was supported by the Australian Government Research Training Program.,,25,1,1,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1178-1653,1178-1661,,PATIENT,Patient,MAY,2021,14,3,,,SI,,359,371,,10.1007/s40271-021-00503-5,,MAR 2021,13,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Health Care Sciences & Services,RU0KU,WOS:000627190900001,33694076,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2021-07-05,

Given the importance of these products, EU authorities and policy-makers are continuously monitoring consumer preferences and attitudes, analysing whether or not the implementation of EU policies and regulations improves the market conditions. For example, the Eurobarometer (European Union, 2018a) surveyed 27,732 EU residents including a specific module to analyse the fishery and aquaculture EU market. In this study, the dataset is used to estimate Ordered Probit models using effects coding and their marginal effects to identify the main determinants of the frequency of FAPs at-home consumption. Results indicate that the highest probability to consume more frequently FAPs is related to considering that one of the main reasons for buying or eating fishery and aquaculture products is because they are healthy, while the highest probability to consume less frequently FAPs is related to consumers who do not understand at all the information accompanying the products. Similarly, other important reasons for consuming FAPs more frequently are their good taste and low relative price. Also, results indicate a higher frequency of consumption of FAPs for those consumers who are over 55 years of age, are wealthy, have a wild product preference, live in a household of 3 persons or more and are very satisfied with their lives.

Data Sources Primary qualitative and quantitative data collected on a representative sample of individuals with at least one of the fifteen most prevalent long-term conditions in the UK. Study Design Targeted literature review followed by a series of one-to-one qualitative semistructured interviews and a large-scale discrete choice experiment. Data Collection Digital recording of one-to-one qualitative interviews, one-to-one cognitive interviews, and a series of online quantitative surveys, including two best-worst scaling and one discrete choice experiment, with individuals with long-term conditions. Principal Findings On average, patients preferred a self-management support intervention that (a) discusses the options available to the patient and make her choose, (b) is individual-based, (c) face to face (d) with doctor or nurse, (e) at the GP practice, (f) sessions shorter than 1 hour, and (g) occurring annually for two-third of the sample and monthly for the rest. We found heterogeneity in preferences via three latent classes, with class sizes of 41% (C1), 30% (C2), and 29% (C3). The individuals' gender [P < 0.05(C1), P < 0.01(C3)], age [P < 0.05(C1), P < 0.05(C2)], type of long-term condition [P < 0.05(C1), P < 0.01(C3)], and presence of comorbidity [P < 0.01(C1), P < 0.01(C3), P < 0.01(C3)] were able to characterize differences between these latent classes and help understand the heterogeneity of preferences toward the above mentioned features of self-management support interventions. These findings were then used to profile individuals into different preference groups, for each of whom the most desirable form of self-management support, one that was more likely to be adopted by the recipient, could be designed. Conclusions We identified several factors that could be used to inform a more nuanced self-management support service design and provision that take into account the recipient's characteristics and preferences.","[Iglesias Urrutia, Cynthia P.] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Erdem, Seda] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling, Scotland; [Birks, Yvonne F.] Univ York, Social Policy Res Unit, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Taylor, Stephanie J.

This study investigated heterogeneous consumer preferences for eggs from the welfare enhanced production systems, and further, how the effects of information regarding these production systems depended on consumers? previous purchase experience and initial perceptions. A nationally representative sample of respondents completed a self-reported survey and a set of discrete choice experiments on egg products. Respondents were randomly assigned into two groups, with one group being offered additional information regarding the pros and cons of each housing system on various aspects (i.e., animal welfare and environmental impacts). Using the conditional logit models, results showed that consumers? willingness to pay (WTP) for egg attributes depended on previous purchase experience. Those who had purchased cage-free eggs before were willing to pay up to $1.39/dozen higher premium for the advanced cages. Furthermore, the informational impacts depended on consumers? purchase experience and initial perceptions. Inexperienced consumers were more responsive to information compared to the experienced consumers. The mixed information decreased price premium by up to 75%. Inexperienced consumers with higher perceived importance on welfare or environmental issues showed even more preference updates. While the prior attitudes helped the experienced consumers to differentiate across products, additional information lowered these attitudinal effects. These results implied that information that aimed to educate the general public had higher marginal effects on the inexperienced consumers than on the experienced ones.","[Cao, Ying (Jessica); Cranfield, John; Chen, Chen] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Cao, Ying (Jessica)] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Widowski, Tina] Univ Guelph, Dept Anim Biosci, Guelph, ON, Canada","Cao, Y (corresponding author), 760B WARF,610 Walnut St, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",ycao245@wisc.edu,,,"Poultry Industry Council [310]; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs [200424/200427]; University of WisconsinMadison [135-AAI2989, 233-NEWPROJ]","The financial supports from the Poultry Industry Council (Project Number 310), the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (Project number 200424/200427) and University of WisconsinMadison (Project numbers 135-AAI2989 and 233-NEWPROJ) are gratefully acknowledged.

Despite the theoretical potential of private insurance in LTC financing reforms, the reality is that the market remains remarkably underdeveloped. This study adopts a novel two-phase approach to quantitatively examine the market demand for private long-term care insurance (LTCI) in Hong Kong, one of the world's super-ageing societies. In order to examine people's preferences regarding private LTCI in Hong Kong, which has been exploring alternative LTC financing mechanisms to relieve the overburdened public system, we conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in 2019 to elicit the preferences of a representative sample of 410 middle-aged adults. At first, we used data from the US National Longterm Care Survey to perform an actuarial projection for Hong Kong. In the first phase, we computed the indicative premiums based on various attributes of hypothetical private LTCI products. Undertaken in the second phase and using two econometric techniques, the DCE suggested that the most preferred hypothetical LTCI product in Hong Kong was associated with the following features: 1) a monthly benefit level of HK$20,000 or HK$25,000, 2) 3% inflation protection, and 3) 15 years of contribution. These attributes led to a monthly premium of HK$1237 (US$160)/HK$1546 (US$200) for men and HK$2150 (US$278)/HK$2687 (US$348) for women. Furthermore, we also found that the preference for LTCI products varied across people with different socioeconomic and health characteristics. These insights could inform initial market segmentation, LTCI product design, and targeted marketing in the future. This paper concludes with cautious optimism regarding the market demand for private LTCI in Hong Kong, and recommends concrete policy instruments to nurture the LTCI market, including information campaign, premium subsidies, and tax benefits.","[He, Alex Jingwei; Chou, Kee-lee] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Policy Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Qian, Jiwei] Natl Univ Singapore, East Asian Inst, 469 Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259756, Singapore; [Chan, Wai-sum] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Finance, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Qian, JW (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, East Asian Inst, 469 Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259756, Singapore.",jiwei.qian@nus.edu.sg,"qian, jiwei/A-2376-2019","qian, jiwei/0000-0002-4031-0287; Chan, Wai-Sum/0000-0002-6021-0312; Chou, Kee Lee/0000-0003-3627-9915","Public Policy Research Funding Scheme (PPR), the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office, The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government [2017.A5.034.18B]","This study was funded by the Public Policy Research Funding Scheme (PPR), the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office, The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (Ref. 2017.A5.034.18B).",,59,0,0,11,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0277-9536,1873-5347,,SOC SCI MED,Soc.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect pictures have on peoples' preferences toward in ovo sexing at different stages of embryonic development and chick culling. For this purpose, an online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 482 respondents in Germany. A within-subject design with 2 choice experiments was used to investigate the influence pictures have on respondents' preferences and willingness to pay. The first-choice experiment contained plain text only; the second contained also pictures of a chick or the incubated eggs at the corresponding stages of development. Findings reveal that in ovo gender determination at each proposed day of incubation (d1, d4, and d9) was preferred to chick culling. In ovo screening on d1 and d4 was significantly preferred to d9. This preference for early gender determination increased significantly as a consequence to the provision of pictures. Results furthermore reveal that a high error rate of gender determination or the lack of a meaningful utilization of incubated eggs can decrease approval for in ovo gender determination to an extent, where no positive willingness to pay remains. Findings of this study are useful for stakeholders in poultry production when considering the implementation of in ovo gender determination as a morally admissible substitute to chick culling.","[Reithmayer, Corrina; Danne, Michael; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Reithmayer, C (corresponding author), Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",corrina.reithmayer@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,,"Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany","This work was supported by the Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany.",,64,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,1525-3171,,POULTRY SCI,Poult.

Setting: Online national panel survey. Participants: For a representative sample of US adults (n 1030), survey responses were collected in 2018 and analysed in 2019. Results: First, 29-47 % of respondents incorrectly identified the healthier product from paired options, and respondents who self-identified as having difficulty in understanding labels were more likely to err. Second, for actual products composed primarily of refined grains, 43-51 % of respondents overstated the WG content, whereas for one product composed primarily of WG, 17 % of respondents understated the WG content. Conclusions: The frequency of consumer misunderstanding of grain product labels was high in both study components.

However, in spite of the European Union's ambition to involve local communities for co-driving the low-carbon energy transition, there is no comprehensive analysis quantifying citizens' potential to co-finance and participate in community renewable energy initiatives across Europe. We address this knowledge gap through a representative choice experiment survey that collected responses from 16,235 participants to different hypothetical investment options on renewable energy schemes across all European Union Member States, and estimate the social potential of European citizens to participate and invest in community-administered wind farms. Results from a novel surveybased social simulation indicate that 176 billion could be obtained from citizen-led finance in community-administered wind farm developments, enough to halve the investment gap to achieve a 32% renewable energy share in final energy consumption by 2030. Our analysis substantiates the case for facilitating easily accessible, risk-insured community investment options across Europe to unlock citizens' social potential for investing in community renewable energy.","[de Brauwer, C.

Despite the wide communication of the ecological key functions of LW, residents rejected its reintroduction in a restoration project at the river Mulde (Dessau-Rosslau, Germany). To determine whether this is a local or widespread phenomenon in Germany, we investigated (a) the German population's attitude toward LW, (b) preferred quantities of LW introduction, and (c) the effects of flood experiences and other sociodemographic characteristics on these preferences. We conducted a nationwide and representative online survey (n= 2,100), including rating-scale statements and a choice experiment (CE). Regarding the rating statements, we found that a majority of respondents (57-67%) is convinced of the advantages of LW reintroduction. However, 47-60% considered LW to be dangerous for canoeists or during floods. For the CE (n= 743), we defined an LW attribute and added information on possible effects. Conditional logit models showed a strong preference for the highest amount of LW, with an odds ratio 5.47 times higher than for the status quo without LW. We also found that personal flood experiences reduce the preferred LW quantities. In contrast, females, higher educational levels, the youngest and oldest age groups, and especially frequent river visitors preferred higher LW amounts. Since the commitment of young people to environmental issues is currently increasing, we believe that specific environmental education opportunities for this group located along the river can contribute significantly to increase acceptance.","[Gapinski, Cedric Mats; Hermes, Johannes; von Haaren, Christina] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Umweltplanung, Herrenhauser Str 2, D-30419 Hannover, Germany","Gapinski, CM (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Umweltplanung, Herrenhauser Str 2, D-30419 Hannover, Germany.",gapinski@umwelt.uni-hannover.de,"Hermes, Johannes/F-5526-2019","Hermes, Johannes/0000-0002-9567-1186","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN); Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) in Germany [01LC1322F]; BMBFFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)","The Wilde Mulde project is jointly funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) with funds also from the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) in Germany (funding code: 01LC1322F).

We conducted the online interviews, with a total of 598 adequately answered questionnaires in summer 2017. The resulting sample is representative of German farmers, as the distribution of participants corresponds very well to the percentage distribution of farms in Germany. The survey contained a discrete choice experiment (DCE), a structured survey of 30 sub-aspects of rewards to be expected from the application of a sustainability standard and a risk elicitation lottery choice-task. Besides, the personal characteristics of the farmers (e.g. gender, education, communication behaviour, age) and farm characteristics (e.g. farm type, size, labour, profit) were recorded. Since the complete raw dataset cannot be published due to the privacy rights of human subjects and the stated data use agreement (DUA) with the participants, the present article demonstrates the data collection process, describes the parameter of the DCE and, present summary statistics of the sample. In addition, we illustrate the variables coding and data structure using a model data set with 10 generated entries. Further, a reduced and edited exercise dataset, which is structured analogous to the real dataset, is used to demonstrate the analysis of the DCE data step-by-step. The results and the interpretation of the actual DCE data analysis are published in the article 'Acceptance of sustainability standards among farmers' - empirical evidence from Germany' [1]. The survey data can provide further insights on farmers' expected rewards from participating in a sustainability standard, on the role of risk perception and tolerance of German farmers, and the role of communication behaviour in the innovation adoption context.

As energy fuel choices have large implications for pollution, a critical question surrounds citizens' preferences for renewable energy versus coal. While a robust literature suggests that citizens are willing to pay for renewables, the applicability of these findings to developing countries remains limited as many studies do not benchmark findings against preferences for increased capacity with dirtier fuels. We estimate citizens' willingness to pay for improved electricity reliability from coal versus renewable technologies using a contingent valuation experiment embedded in a nationally-representative survey of 14,000 respondents across Vietnam, the country with the greatest recent increase in coal consumption. We find that while households are willing to pay 95% more in their monthly electricity bill for renewables (USD 7.5 billion per year in aggregate), they are also willing to pay 62% more for coal plants (USD 4 billion per year). Additionally, income and satisfaction with governance drive support both for renewables and coal, suggesting that agenda setting by policymakers is critical. If citizens are not offered alternatives, a majority will support coal even as governance improves or citizens become wealthier.","[Bakkensen, Laura; Schuler, Paul] Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Bakkensen, L (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",laurabakkensen@email.arizona.edu; pschuler@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,70,0,0,2,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2020,144,,,,,,,,111696,10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111696,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NI9JX,WOS:000565663000002,,,,,2021-07-05,

These SGARIs have similar efficacy but differ in safety profiles. We used a discrete choice experiment to explore how United States physicians make treatment decisions between adverse events (AEs) and survival gains in nmCRPC, a largely asymptomatic disease. Methods Treating physicians (n = 149) participated in an online survey that included 14 treatment choice questions, each comparing 2 hypothetical treatment profiles, which varied in terms of 5 safety and 2 efficacy attributes. We described safety attributes (fatigue, skin rash, cognitive problems, falls, and fractures) in terms of severity and frequency, and efficacy attributes (overall survival [OS] and time to pain progression) in terms of duration of effect. We used a random parameters logit model to estimate preference weights and importance scores for each attribute. We also estimated the amount of survival gain physicians were willing to trade for a reduction in specific AEs between treatment options. Results Physicians placed more importance on survival than on time to pain progression, and viewed a reduction in cognitive problems from severe to none, a reduction in risk of a serious fracture from 8% to none, and a reduction in fatigue from severe to none as the most important safety attributes. Physicians were willing to forego 9.1 and 6.6 months of OS, respectively, to reduce cognitive problems and fatigue from severe to mild-to-moderate. To reduce the risk of a serious fracture from 8 to 5% and 5% to none, physicians were willing to trade 3.9 and 5.3 months of OS, respectively. Conclusions Physicians were willing to trade substantial amounts of survival to avoid AEs between hypothetical treatments. These results emphasize the importance of carefully balancing therapies' benefits and risks to ultimately optimize the overall quality of nmCRPC patients' survival. Nonetheless, it is noted that the results from the study sample of 149 physicans may not be representative of the viewpoints of all nmCRPC-treating physicians.","[Srinivas, Sandy] Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Mohamed, Ateesha F.; Appukkuttan, Sreevalsa; Waldeck, A.

Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a choice experiment (CE) among 626 Italian consumers from Veneto region through an online survey. The study estimates both a conditional logit (CL) and a latent class logit model (LCM). Findings By segmenting the sample based on the heterogeneous preferences of consumers, it can distinguish eco-friendly consumers, time-saving lovers, nationalists and price sensitive subjects. Interestingly, the marginal willingness to pay for ready-to-eat arils is positive for the time-saving lovers that are mainly young consumers. The Italian origin has always a positive effect on the choice, whereas a negative effect is found for the price. Finally, the eco-friendly package has both a negative and a positive effect. Research limitations/implications The sample of this study is not representative of the population and the CE has a hypothetical nature. It follows that further research will link the economic analysis to a consumer test on a more representative sample. Practical implications This study can be useful for the pomegranate producers and the industry because it provides original evidence that could drive their business and marketing strategies, for instance, the preference for ready-to-eat arils. Originality/value This study is one of the first seeking to determine the factors that affect consumers' preferences for pomegranate arils.","[Stiletto, Alice; Giampietri, Elisa; Trestini, Samuele] Univ Padua, Dept TeSAF, Padua, Italy","Trestini, S (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept TeSAF, Padua, Italy.",alice.stiletto@unipd.it; elisa.giampietri@unipd.it; samuele.trestini@unipd.it,"TRESTINI, SAMUELE/B-6157-2012","TRESTINI, SAMUELE/0000-0002-9828-8262; Stiletto, Alice/0000-0002-9797-624X","Veneto Region's Rural Development Program 2014-2020, measure 16.2.1","This research is linked to the VA_MO Project Valore Aggiunto Melograno, financed by the Veneto Region's Rural Development Program 2014-2020, measure 16.2.1, linked with EIP-Agri Network.",,61,2,2,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Methods Three discrete choice experiment (DCE) surveys were designed and administered to separate representative samples of the Australian public. Bayesian D-efficient explicit partial profile designs were used. Choice data were analyzed using a panel error component random parameter logit model. Results Overall, 1913 participants completed the pediatric (n = 533), symptomatic adult (n = 700) and at-risk adult (n = 680) surveys. The willingness-to-pay for GS information in pediatric conditions was estimated at $5470-$15,250 (US$3830-$10,675) depending on the benefits of genomic information. Uptake ranged between 60% and 81%. For symptomatic adults, the value of GS was estimated at $1573-$8102 (US$1100-$5671) and uptake at 34-82%. For at-risk adults, GS was valued at $2036-$5004 (US$1425-$3503) and uptake was predicted at 35-61%. Conclusion There is substantial personal utility in GS, particularly for pediatric conditions. Personal utility increased as the perceived benefits of genomic information increased. The clinical and regulatory context, and individuals' sociodemographic and attitudinal characteristics influenced the value and uptake of GS. Society values highly the diagnostic, clinical, and nonclinical benefits of GS. The personal utility of GS should be considered in health-care decision-making.","[Goranitis, Ilias] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Hlth Econ Unit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Goranitis, Ilias; Best, Stephanie; Christodoulou, John; Stark, Zornitza; Boughtwood, Tiffany] Australian Genom Hlth Alliance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Goranitis, Ilias; Best, Stephanie; Christodoulou, John; Stark, Zornitza; Boughtwood, Tiffany] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Best, Stephanie] Macquarie Univ, Australian Inst Hlth Innovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Christodoulou, John; Stark, Zornitza] Univ Melbourne, Dept Paediat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Goranitis, I (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Hlth Econ Unit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.; Goranitis, I (corresponding author), Australian Genom Hlth Alliance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.; Goranitis, I (corresponding author), Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",ilias.goranitis@unimelb.edu.au,,"Boughtwood, Tiffany/0000-0002-9634-3731; Best, Stephanie/0000-0002-1107-8976; Goranitis, Ilias/0000-0001-7946-8324",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grantNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1113531]; Australian Government's Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF); NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [GNT1113531]; Victorian Government,"We thank the representatives from Genetic Support Network Victoria, Leukodystrophy Australia, Syndromes Without Names (SWAN) Australia, and Usher Kids Australia.

Method A DCE with 200 choice sets of two quality-of-life (QoL) state-duration combinations blocked into 20 survey versions, with ten choice sets in each version, was designed and administered online to a sample representative of the Australian population. Two additional choice sets comprising internal consistency and dominance checks were included in each survey version. A range of model specifications investigating preferences with respect to duration and interactions between AD-5D dimension levels were estimated. Utility weights were developed, with estimated coefficients transformed to the 0 (being dead) to 1 (full health) scale, suitable for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) weights for use in economic evaluation. Results In total, 1999 respondents completed the choice experiment. Overall, respondents were slightly better educated and had higher annual incomes than the Australian general population. The estimation results from different specifications and models were broadly consistent with the monotonic nature of the AD-5D: utility increased with increased life expectancy and decreased as the severity level for each dimension worsened. A utility value set was generated for the calculation of utilities for all QoL states defined by the AD-5D descriptive system. Conclusion The DCE-based utility value set is now available to use to generate QALYs for the economic evaluation of treatments and interventions targeting people with dementia and/or their family caregivers.","[Comans, Tracy A.; Nguyen, Kim-Huong] Univ Queensland, Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Comans, Tracy A.; Nguyen, Kim-Huong] NHMRC Partnership Ctr Dealing Cognit & Related Fu, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Nursing & Hlth Sci, Caring Futures Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Rowen, Donna] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Comans, TA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; Comans, TA (corresponding author), NHMRC Partnership Ctr Dealing Cognit & Related Fu, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",t.comans@uq.edu.au,"Nguyen, Kim-Huong/ABA-5902-2020; Comans, Tracy/D-9308-2018; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Nguyen, Kim-Huong/0000-0002-2592-9372; Comans, Tracy/0000-0003-2840-3496; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Partnership Centre on Dealing with Cognitive and Related Functional Decline in Older PeopleNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [GNT9100000]; NHMRC Boosting Dementia Research FellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia,This study was supported by funding provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Partnership Centre on Dealing with Cognitive and Related Functional Decline in Older People (Grant no.

Tariff sets are available for Australia, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA. Objective Our objective was to develop tariff sets for the CarerQol instrument for Hungary, Poland and Slovenia and to compare these with the existing value sets. Methods Discrete-choice experiments were carried out in Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. Data were collected through an online survey between November 2018 and January 2019, using representative samples of 1000 respondents per country. Tariffs were calculated from coefficient estimates from panel mixed multinomial logit models with random parameters. Results All seven CarerQol domains contributed significantly to the utility associated with different caregiving situations. Attributes valued highest were 'physical health' (tariffs for no problems were 15.6-21.8), 'mental health' (18.1-18.9) and 'fulfilment' (16.3-22.9). Value sets were comparable across the countries, although in Poland 'a lot of fulfilment' was valued higher (22.9) than in Hungary (16.3) and Slovenia (17.1). Compared with existing value sets, in the three Central European countries, 'fulfilment' was more important, whereas 'financial problems' were less important. Conclusion For the first time in the Central and Eastern European region, country-specific tariffs are now available for the Hungarian, Polish and Slovenian versions of the CarerQol instrument. This facilitates inclusion of the impact of informal care in economic evaluations. Our results can be used to develop and evaluate country-specific health policy strategies to support informal caregivers. The differences found in informal care preferences highlight the limited transferability of CarerQol tariffs across European regions.","[Baji, Petra; Zrubka, Zsombor; Gulacsi, Laszlo; Pentek, Marta] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Farkas, Miklos] Univ Bristol, Dept Accounting & Finance, Priory Rd Complex, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [Golicki, Dominik] Med Univ Warsaw, Dept Expt & Clin Pharmacol, Ul Banacha 1b, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland; [Rupel, Valentina] Inst Econ Res, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Hoefman, Renske] Netherlands Inst Social Res, The Hague, Netherlands; [Brouwer, Werner B.

In these situations, understanding the values of the general population could help doctors provide appropriate guidance to surrogate decision makers. Methods Using a discrete choice experiment design, we conducted an online survey using an Australian panel. Participants were asked about their willingness to accept treatments, faced with a variety of possible outcomes and probabilities (low, moderate or high). The outcomes were across four domains: loss of functional autonomy, pain, cognitive disability and degree of burden on others. Demographic details, prior experience of intensive care unit and current health conditions were also collected. Data were analysed using logistic regression, predicting whether respondents choose to continue active treatment or not. Results Nine hundred and eighty-four respondents, representative of age and sex completed the web-based survey. With the increasing likelihood of negative post-intensive care unit sequelae, there was a higher probability of the respondent preferring to stop ongoing active treatment, with the largest coefficients being on caring assistance and the need for full-time residential care. Those who identified as very religious, were younger or who had children under 5 years of age were more likely to choose to continue active treatment. Conclusions Respondents valued their independence as the most important factor in deciding whether to receive ongoing medical treatments in the intensive care unit. When clinicians are unable to obtain specific patient information, they should consider framing their decision making around the likelihood of the patient achieving functional independence rather than survival.","[Anstey, Matthew H.] Sir Charles Gairdner Hosp, Dept Intens Care, Level 4 G Block,Hosp Ave, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Anstey, Matthew H.; Norman, Richard] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia; [Mitchell, Imogen A.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Mitchell, Imogen A.] Canberra Hosp, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Corke, Charlie] Univ Hosp Geelong, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Anstey, MH (corresponding author), Sir Charles Gairdner Hosp, Dept Intens Care, Level 4 G Block,Hosp Ave, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.; Anstey, MH (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia.",matthew.anstey@health.wa.gov.au,,,Sir Charles Gairdner Research Advisory Council [2016-17/023],This trial was supported by a Grant from the Sir Charles Gairdner Research Advisory Council (Grant no. 2016-17/023).,,26,1,1,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1178-1653,1178-1661,,PATIENT,Patient,JUN,2020,13,3,,,,,339,346,,10.1007/s40271-020-00410-1,,FEB 2020,8,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Health Care Sciences & Services,LK9AS,WOS:000510428900001,32009209,,,,2021-07-05,

A new online tool for creating personal and social EQ-5D-5L value sets was recently developed and Walled in New Zealand (NZ). The tool, which includes extensive checks of the quality of participants' data, implements the PAPRIKA method - a novel type of adaptive discrete choice experiment in the present context - and a binary search algorithm to identify any health states worse than dead. After development and testing, the tool was distributed in an online survey in February and March 2018 to a representative sample of NZ adults (N = 5112), whose personal value sets were created. The tool's extensive data quality checks resulted in a 'high-quality' sub-sample of 2468 participants whose personal value sets were, in effect, averaged to create a social value set for NZ. These results overall as well as feedback from participants indicates that the new valuation tool is feasible and acceptable to participants, enabling valuation data to be relatively easily and cheaply collected. The tool could also be used in other countries, tested against other methods for creating EQ-5D-5L value sets, applied in personalised medicine and adapted to create value sets for other health descriptive systems.","[Sullivan, Trudy; Derrett, Sarah] Univ Otago, Dept Prevent & Social Med, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Hansen, Paul] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Hansen, Paul; Ombler, Franz] 1000minds Ltd, Wellington, New Zealand; [Devlin, Nancy] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Hlth Policy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Sullivan, T (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Prevent & Social Med, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",trudy.sullivan@otago.ac.nz; paul.hansen@otago.ac.nz; franz@1000minds.com; sarah.derrett@otago.ac.nz; nancy.devlin@unimelb.edu.au,,"Derrett, Sarah/0000-0003-2867-0498",,,,51,5,5,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0277-9536,1873-5347,,SOC SCI MED,Soc.

Our results indicate that a local resource tax that benefits the entire community is favored over individual financial participation models (namely, the opportunity for local citizens to participate through shares or bonds). For key stakeholders such as community attached people or those with a politically centrist, progressive mindset, the local resource tax leads to a significant increase in acceptance.

Choice-experiment surveys were conducted in workshop settings and through the internet. Both survey approaches provided some similar results, such as preferences for protection. Our cross-country comparison showed the general public in Norway and Ireland was willing, despite possible conflict with extractive and consumptive economic activities in the deep sea, to protect cold-water corals as habitat for fish. On average, people were willing to pay NKr 341 and NKr 424 for a small and large increase in protected areas respectively, and NKr 880 if the area is important habitat for fish, all else held equal. However, there was large variation across individuals and countries. Norwegian respondents valued pure existence of cold-water corals more than the Irish respondents, and the latter were less willing to trade off industrial activities than the former.

These discrepancies suggest a high sensitivity of the results on income comparison attitudes to the design of the data. Next, we randomly provide information that increases the salience of income-comparison attitudes, and find that this treatment further increases disutility among the British.

We conducted a representative survey in the German-speaking part of Switzerland to elicit the population's preferences for electricity from solar, wind or natural gas under different institutional and site-specific conditions. Based on a choice experiment we found a consistent preference for electricity based on solar energy and - to a lesser degree - wind energy, built in existing industrial and commercial areas. We identified five distinct population groups, three of which have a very pronounced profile concerning energy attributes: 'Pro Renewables', 'Pro Switzerland', and 'Pro Landscape'. The largest two groups, Moderates' and 'Contra Status Quo' value attributes fairly equally. All groups except Pro Landscape prefer electricity from Switzerland, and all groups except Pro Switzerland accept imports of renewable electricity, preferably from plants operated by Swiss firms. We suggest that unfamiliarity rather than nationalism is at the root of opposition to imports of renewables. An energy mix focusing on renewables and including border-crossing electricity infrastructure could pave the way for a cost-efficient energy transition towards a sustainable and resilient electricity system.

Many studies investigate public preferences through surveys taken from samples, but to be representative, these samples must reflect value judgments of all relevant population subgroups. In this study, we explore whether, next to better-understood sources of heterogeneity such as age, education or gender, also differences in personality play a role in how people want to set limits to health care. We investigate the influence of dispositional optimism: whether someone anticipates a good or bad future. This is an important personality dimension that has been shown to widely reverberate into people's lives and that can also be expected to influence people's views on health care. To test our hypothesis, we asked a representative sample of the Belgian population (N=750) to complete both the revised life orientation test and a discrete choice experiment about allocating healthcare resources, and we investigated the relationships between both measurements. We found that more pessimistic individuals were less supportive of using patients' age as a selection criterion and more hesitant to invest in prevention. Since individual dispositions are usually not part of the criteria for selecting representative samples, our findings point at a potential non-response bias in studies that elicit social values.","[Luyten, Jeroen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Inst Healthcare Policy, Kapucijnenvoer 35, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Kessels, Roselinde; Goos, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Kessels, Roselinde] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Econ, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Desmet, Pieter] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Inst Law & Econ, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,Postbus 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Goos, Peter] Univ Leuven, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Biosyst, Kasteelpk Arenberg 30,POB 2456, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Beutels, Philippe] Univ Antwerp, CHERMID, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Beutels, Philippe] Univ New South Wales, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Luyten, J (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Inst Healthcare Policy, Kapucijnenvoer 35, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",jeroen.luyten@kuleuven.be; roselinde.kessels@uantwerpen.be; p.t.m.desmet@law.eur.nl; peter.goos@kuleuven.be; philippe.beutels@uantwerpen.be,"Beutels, Philippe/A-1919-2010; Goos, Peter/AAP-7890-2020; Kessels, Roselinde/N-8479-2016","Beutels, Philippe/0000-0001-5034-3595; Kessels, Roselinde/0000-0002-4534-0047; Goos, Peter/0000-0002-3854-6506; Luyten, Jeroen/0000-0001-6398-4025","Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO)FWO [G098911N, G043815N]; Research Foundation-Flanders (Roselinde Kessels' postdoctoral fellowship); Pfizer's European HTAcademy prize competition (2011); Antwerp Study Centre for Infectious Diseases (ASCID) at the University of Antwerp","The authors acknowledge funding from the Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO, Project Numbers G098911N and G043815N, and Roselinde Kessels' postdoctoral fellowship) and Pfizer's European HTAcademy prize competition (2011) and the Antwerp Study Centre for Infectious Diseases (ASCID) at the University of Antwerp.

To this end, we conduct a choice experiment involving a representative sample of 700 households from Beirut, Lebanon, designed around the purchase of a high risk Middle Eastern traditional street food, shawarma. The surveyed household sample was divided among two treatments where one was provided with additional quantitative risk reduction information, hence labeled informed versus the other which is labeled as uninformed. Accordingly, we compare the willingness to pay (WTP) values between both informed and uninformed respondents given typical risk reduction levels using mixed-logit. The analysis illustrates that consumers were less likely to choose more expensive products-all else being equal-with the average consumer preferring to buy shawarma sandwiches from round the corner shops as opposed to walking for more than 10 min, driving or ordering delivery. However, when food safety attributes were introduced preference shifted significantly toward food safety certification in all iterations as compared to no certification. This preference is independent of whether risk reduction information was provided. Nevertheless, once quantitative risk reduction information was shared, the results revealed a decrease in preference for food safety certificates. Accordingly, our results query the validity of incomplete risk information in food safety certifications and challenge some of the implications of risk communication on consumers' choice highlighting the need for improved and well-defined risk communication strategies. Practical applications Based on our results, we foresee a merit for public authorities in Lebanon to review and upgrade the current food safety monitoring and certification services and couple them with assertive and well-publicized risk reduction communication strategies. On the other hand, we suggest that the cost associated with these services should be heavily discounted or subsidized to benefit small and street food vendors. This will provide a powerful incentive for them to substantially improve on their food safety and hygiene practices. Given the evidence on the high premiums consumers are willing to pay for safer foods and transparent risk communication, such an incentive will become more persuasive for small food vendors. Accordingly, this will establish a robust market for street food safety in general and street foodborne risk communication in particular with considerable welfare gains to street food vendors which will ultimately shape consumer behavior.","[Chalak, Ali] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Agr, Beirut, Lebanon; [Diab, Mohammad; Kassem, Issmat I.; Abiad, Mohamad G.] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Beirut, Lebanon","Abiad, MG (corresponding author), Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Agr, Beirut, Lebanon.",ma192@aub.edu.lb,"Chalak, Ali/Y-3921-2019","Chalak, Ali/0000-0001-7111-6674; KASSEM, ISSMAT/0000-0002-2978-9573; Abiad, Mohamad/0000-0001-7263-7471",American University of Beirut; University Research Board (URB); Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique,American University of Beirut; University Research Board (URB); Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique,,29,0,0,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0149-6085,1745-4565,,J FOOD SAFETY,J.

Methods A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) was designed to elicit an individual's willingness to accept compensation for different care tasks. Respondents were presented choice sets that included a care package comprising different amounts and types of care and asked to choose between the care package provided free of charge or providing that care themselves and receiving cash compensation. The care package included personal care, social support, household errands and housework, with the value of compensation, number of care hours provided and types of care varied across the choice sets. Choices were analysed using a generalised multinomial logit model and latent class model. Results A representative sample of 198 caregivers completed the survey (response rate 52%). Participants were recruited in Australia. Overall, caregivers would accept a minimum of Australian dollars ($A)20.61 to provide 1 h of care. The preferences for assistance varied significantly with different types of care tasks. Individuals placed the highest value on receiving assistance with social support ($A35.96) and the least value on receiving assistance with household errands ($A-0.92) ConclusionsThis study produces a value of informal care provided to children with ID that can be directly applied in economic evaluations. The study shows that informal care tasks are not valued equally. Caregivers placed the most value on receiving assistance with social support, which may reflect the time spent by caregivers on these tasks.","[Arora, Sheena; Goodall, Stephen; Viney, Rosalie] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Einfeld, Stewart] Univ Sydney, Brain & Mind Ctr, 94 Mallett St, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia","Arora, S (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",sheena.arora@chere.uts.edu.au; stephen.goodall@chere.uts.edu.au; rosalie.viney@chere.uts.edu.au; stewart.einfeld@sydney.edu.au,,"Arora, Sheena/0000-0002-7562-2416; Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635","Australian Government, National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1016919]; Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science","This study received funding via a programme grant from the Australian Government, National Health and Medical Research Council (grant no. 1016919).

Communicating the climate impact of products to the consumer is difficult and the design of the label might be the key to its success. For this reason, the present study compares the utilities of six different carbon footprint labels to evaluate which label design works best for the consumer. 598 consumers were surveyed in a representative online choice-experiment. The participants had to choose between tomatoes with different product characteristics, such as origin, price, organic label, and carbon footprint label. A split sample approach was used where each sub-sample with around n = 100 saw a different carbon footprint label design in the choice-experiment. The results suggest that qualitative carbon footprint labels using color-coded traffic light labelling are superior to those that claim climate impact reduction or neutrality, including those that provide more details regarding the climate impact of the product and the company. The latent class analysis with four consumer segments shows that a significant proportion of consumers in Germany would consider a carbon footprint label as an important characteristic.","[Meyerding, Stephan G.

Overall, our findings show robustness between the willingness to pay (WTP) estimates elicited via a latent class model (LCM) and those from a payment card question. In both cases results show an average positive WTP, although insufficient to actually cover the extra cost of HEVs. The lack of interest for HEVs may be motivated by different reasons, including the low level of information related to this technology, and additional false believes about the autonomy of these vehicles. Furthermore, drivers who declare a willingness to buy HEVs do not always do so for environmental reasons, but rather for reputational issues related to their self-image. Thus, in order to increase the market share for HEV vehicles in the Spanish market, informative campaigns and additional economic incentives may be designed.","[Rahmani, Djamel] CREDA UPC IRTA, Barcelona, Spain; [Loureiro, Maria L.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain","Loureiro, ML (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.",djamel.rahmani@upc.edu; maria.loureiro@usc.es,"RAHMANI, DJAMEL/S-2309-2018; Loureiro, Maria L./Q-2384-2015","RAHMANI, DJAMEL/0000-0002-7123-5232; Loureiro, Maria L./0000-0002-7082-3980",Fundacion Ramon Areces; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion [ECO2016-79446-R],"The authors acknowledge and thank the financial support received from Fundacion Ramon Areces, and the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion via the grant agreement ECO2016-79446-R.",,55,4,4,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Extrinsic incentives, which have been effective for improving adult health, could improve FBT engagement. OBJECTIVE To assess parents' preferences for FBT incentives. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Survey study of parents of children aged 6 to 17 years with obesity (body mass index in >= 95th percentile for age and sex). Parents' preferences for FBT incentive program attributes were assessed in a discrete choice experiment conducted using a nationally representative, web-based survey in March 2018. Attributes included (1) the monetary value of the incentive, (2) the payment structure, (3) the goal being incentivized, and (4) the person(s) being incentivized. A fractional factorial design was used to create a set of profiles representing hypothetical FBT incentives. Parents were presented with 10 pairs of profiles and asked which would most motivate them in FBT. Parents were also asked about preferences between a small, guaranteed incentive and a lottery for a large incentive. Analyses used a hierarchical Bayesian model and linear regressions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Parents' preference for different incentive program attributes and levels. RESULTS The nationally representative survey had a 41.4% eligibility rate (n=339) and a 89.7% completion rate (n=304). A total of 53.3% of respondents (weighted percentage) were non-Hispanic white, 42.6% had an annual household income less than $50 000, and 28.3% had a bachelor's degree. Parents preferred higher incentives, although they were willing to accept lower-value incentives if both the parent and the child (vs the child alone) were required to meet the goal (mean difference [MD], -$108; 95% CI, -$132 to -$84), if the incentive used a gain-framed vs loss-framed payment structure (MD, -$72; 95% CI, -$85 to -$59), and if physical activity goals were incentivized over weight loss (MD, -$63; 95% CI, -$82 to -$44) or dietary monitoring (MD, -$5; 95% CI, -$1 to $28). Only 20.6% of parents preferred a lottery over a guaranteed payment. Preferences did not vary among demographic or health subgroups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, parent-stated preferences did not align with FBT best practices or behavioral economic theory. A randomized clinical trial could examine whether aligning incentives with preferences or best practices would maximize FBT engagement and behavior change.","[Wright, Davene R.; Saelens, Brian E.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, M-S CW-8-6,POB 5371, Seattle, WA 98145 USA; [Wright, Davene R.; Saelens, Brian E.] Seattle Childrens Res Inst, Ctr Child Hlth Behav & Dev, Seattle, WA USA; [Saelens, Brian E.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98145 USA; [Fontes, Angela] Univ Chicago, NORC, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lavelle, Tara A.] Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Lavelle, Tara A.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA","Wright, DR (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, M-S CW-8-6,POB 5371, Seattle, WA 98145 USA.",davene.wright@seattlechildrens.org,,"Saelens, Brian/0000-0001-6998-6339",American Heart AssociationAmerican Heart Association [16GRNT31390024],This work was funded by the American Heart Association (grant 16GRNT31390024).,,52,3,3,0,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2574-3805,,,JAMA NETW OPEN,JAMA Netw.

Despite the immense investment costs, river restoration benefits have not been valued in monetary terms, and a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) does not exist for any river restoration project in Switzerland. We apply stated preference methods to elicit public preferences and willingness to pay for restoring two specific but representative river sites. The benefits of restoration are compared with its costs. Upscaling the results to the national level shows that the government budget allocated for river restoration (CHF 1200/m) is insufficient to cover the costs of local restoration projects. However, the surveyed local populations are willing to pay substantially more for restoring rivers in their area of residence than they are legally obliged to do. The CBA results demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the costs in the two case studies, and hence that restoration efforts are justified from an economic point of view. A sensitivity analysis shows that the main results and conclusions do not change when we change some of the key assumptions underlying the CBA.","[Logar, Ivana; Brouwer, Roy] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Social Sci, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Water Inst, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Paillex, Amael] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Paillex, Amael] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal Integrated Assessment & Modelling, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland","Logar, I (corresponding author), Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Social Sci, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",ivana.logar@eawag.ch; rbrouwer@uwaterloo.ca; amael.paillex@eawag.ch,"; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","paillex, amael/0000-0001-9255-3662; Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050","Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology","This research was funded by Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology.

We assess latent demand, defined as what ZEV sales could be if they were fully available (in a wide variety of makes and models), and if consumers were fully aware of their existence. Using an in-depth, Reflexive Participant approach to data collection, our survey instrument includes two measures of latent demand: a design space exercise and a stated choice experiment. The survey was completed by a representative sample of 2123 new vehicle-buying households in Canada in 2017. Part 1 (this paper) focuses on the design space exercise, which allows consumers to design a conventional, hybrid, or ZEV drivetrain, including specific attribute levels. Under higher and lower price conditions, 14% and 21% of respondents (respectively) select a ZEV, with most selecting PHEVs (11% and 12%), followed by BEVs (2.2% and 5.4%), and HFCVs (1.5% and 3.6%). Most respondents who design a PHEV or HFCV as their first choice select a conventional or hybrid vehicle as their second choice, while BEV designers tend to select a PHEV as their second choice. Further, those who select PHEVs and BEVs have higher levels of environmental-oriented lifestyle engagement and altruistic values, whereas respondents who select HFCVs score lower for both constructs. Results provide one measure of latent demand, while also indicating heterogeneity in demand and motivations.

While Part 1 (Long et al., this issue) reports on a design space exercise, here we summarize results from a stated choice experiment, using a latent class choice model to quantify respondent preferences and motivations, and the heterogeneity therein. We identify five unique respondent classes (or segments) that largely differ by their preferred drivetrain, only three of which demonstrate significant interest in ZEVs: PEV-enthusiast (representing 13% of the sample), PHEV-oriented (22%), and ZEV-neutral (21%). Respondents in all three classes tend to have higher levels of environmental concern or engagement in an environment-oriented lifestyle. All classes significantly value purchase price and incentives, but vary widely in valuation of fuel savings, charging access, and refueling access - with little overall valuation of driving range and public charging access. We calculate conditional choice probabilities as estimates of ZEV latent demand, which is equivalent to 29% of new market share under base conditions, and significantly increases to a high of 49% with purchase incentives and widespread charger deployment. Our discussion compares insights provided by the two stated response approaches to latent demand (in Parts 1 and 2), making a case for overall complementarity.","[Kormos, Christine; Axsen, Jonn; Long, Zoe; Goldberg, Suzanne] Simon Fraser Univ, Sustainable Transportat Act Res Team, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Axsen, J (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sustainable Transportat Act Res Team, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",jaxsen@sfu.ca,,,"Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS); Community Trust Endowment Fund (CTEF) at Simon Fraser Univeresity; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); City of Vancouver, Metro Vancouver","This study was funded by the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS), the Community Trust Endowment Fund (CTEF) at Simon Fraser Univeresity, the City of Vancouver, Metro Vancouver, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).

To date, no French study has interrogated women's points of view and preferences (in the economic sense) for this controversial screening. This study aims to bridge this gap. We aimed to elicit women's trade-offs between the benefits and harms of BCS. Methods: A discrete choice experiment questionnaire was developed and administered by a survey institute to French women in order to elicit their preferences and trade-offs between the benefits and risks of BCS (i.e., overdiagnosis and false-positive mammography). Results: Eight hundred and twelve women, representative of the French general population (age, socioeconomic level, and geographical location), completed the survey. The women would be willing to accept on average 14.1 overdiagnosis cases (median = 9.6) and 47.8 women with a false-positive result (median = 27.2) to avoid one BC-related death. Results from our simulations predict that less than 50% of women would be willing to accept 10 overdiagnosis cases (respectively, 30 women with a false-positive mammography) for one BC-related death avoided.

Especially their high degree of biodiversity and structural diversity result in high recreational and experiential value. Within the concept of ecosystem services, human interaction with a river landscape for the purpose of recreation is classified as cultural service. Knowledge of the societal value of this cultural ecosystem service can make an important contribution to the decision-making process of the design of river landscapes.The aim of the present study is to collect empirical data on recreational use and the valuation of river landscapes in Germany and to derive willingness-to-pay estimates for different development alternatives. In two research projects, around 4,000 people were questioned regarding their current use of rivers and streams for recreational purposes within a representative survey. The regional focus of this study is set on small rivers or streams in the state of Saxony, as well as on the major rivers Danube, Nahe and Aller. The use of choice experiments, a survey-based method for assessing individual preferences, enables the estimation of the importance of individual characteristics of a river landscape for the valuation and recreational site choice. Different measures are considered with regard to river banks, to the use of floodplains, and to the accessibility of the river and infrastructure developments. Taking into account different rivers allows a comparison of the recreational determinants of large and small waters. The respondents express a high appreciation for an increased naturalness of river banks and floodplains with willingness-to-pay values of more than 120 (sic) per household and year. In contrast, further infrastructural development (cycle tracks, hiking trails) is valuated very differently by users and non-users.","[Rayanov, Marin; Dehnhardt, Alexandra; Glockmann, Manon; Hartje, Volkmar; Hirschfeld, Jesko; Sagebiel, Julian] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landschaftsarchitektur & Umweltplanung, Fachgebiet Landschaftsokon Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Dehnhardt, Alexandra; Hirschfeld, Jesko; Lindow, Maria; Welling, Malte] Inst Okol Wirtschaftsforsch IOW Berlin, Potsdamer Str 105, D-10785 Berlin, Germany; [Thiele, Julia] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Umweltplanung, Herrenhauser Str 2, D-30419 Hannover, Germany","Rayanov, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landschaftsarchitektur & Umweltplanung, Fachgebiet Landschaftsokon Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",m.rayanov@tu-berlin.de; alexandra.dehnhardt@tu-berlin.de; volkmar.hartje@tu-berlin.de; jesko.hirschfeld@ioew.de; maria.lindow@burg-lenzen.de; sagebiel@tu-berlin.de; thiele@umwelt.uni-hannover.de; malte.welling@ioew.de,"Sagebiel, Julian/I-5888-2019","Sagebiel, Julian/0000-0002-0253-6875",,,,28,2,2,3,25,BUNDESANSTALT GEWASSERKUNDE-BFG,KOBLENZ,"POSTFACH 200 253, KOBLENZ, 56002, GERMANY",1439-1783,,,HYDROL WASSERBEWIRTS,Hydrol.

In Ireland pike stocks are actively managed within specific fisheries for the purpose of protecting brown trout stocks. Associated public discussion is increasingly polarized with a clear message that trout anglers favour and pike anglers oppose such management intervention. A first step towards successfully managing the tension between all stakeholders is a better understanding of the broad spectrum of anglers' views. Latent-class site-choice models are estimated with choice experiment data to reveal information on anglers' preferences with the data collected via an online survey from 341 members of a recreational angling research panel. Several policy relevant lessons arise from the analysis. First, anglers' preferences are not homogeneous, either among pike or trout anglers. Angler stakeholder groups cannot reasonably attest to represent all pike or trout anglers. There are multiple distinct classes of anglers with quite different preferences on pike stock control as well as other fishery attributes, such as bag limits and catch rates. Second, while anglers have strong preferences across a number of fishery attributes (e.g. catch rates, pollution, invasive weeds, etc.), pike stock control is the predominant attribute affecting anglers' behaviour. Third, among trout anglers there is a sizeable majority opposed to the maintenance of existing pike stock control measures, which is at odds with a vociferous public campaign led by trout angling representative organizations. The preferences of this 'silent' majority reflect the fact that approximately 2-in-5 trout anglers also fish for pike. In general, the research helps inform fishery management decisions, dispelling the idea of a clear dichotomy between pike and trout anglers and instead illuminates the complexity of anglers' preferences.","[Curtis, John] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Curtis, John] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","Curtis, J (corresponding author), Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",john.curtis@esri.ie,"Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684",Inland Fisheries Ireland,This research has been financially supported by Inland Fisheries Ireland.

Methods: A large online survey was conducted using a discrete choice experiment including a duration attribute with adult members of the Netherlands general population (N = 1276) who were representative in terms of age, gender, marital status, employment, education, and region. Respondents were asked which of two health states they prefer, where each health state was described using the nine dimensions of the Child Health Utility 9D (worried, sad, pain, tired, annoyed, school work/homework, sleep, daily routine, able to join in activities) and duration. The data were modeled using conditional logit with robust standard errors to produce utility values for every health state described by the Child Health Utility 9D. Results: The majority of the dimension level coefficients were monotonic, leading to a decrease in utility as severity increases. There was, however, evidence of some logical inconsistencies, particularly for the school work/homework dimension. The value set produced was based on the ordered model and ranges from -0.568 for the worst state to 1 for the best state. Conclusion: The valuation of the Child Health Utility 9D using online discrete choice experiment with duration with adult members of the Dutch general population was feasible and produced a valid model for use in cost utility analysis. Normative questions are raised around the valuation of pediatric preference-based measures, including the appropriate perspective for imagining hypothetical pediatric health states.","[Rowen, Donna; Stevens, Katherine] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Vermaire, Jan Hendrik] TNO Child Hlth, Oral Hlth Div, Leiden, Netherlands; [Vermaire, Jan Hendrik] Univ Groningen, Ctr Tandheelkunde & Mondzorgkunde, Groningen, Netherlands","Rowen, D (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",d.rowen@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Vermaire, J.H.

This study estimated utilities for treatment-related health states of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and disutilities of severe adverse events (SAEs) using a representative sample of adults from the general population in the United States (US). Methods: Treatment-related AML health states, defined based on literature and interviews with clinicians, included complete remission (CR), no CR, relapse, stem cell transplant (SCT), and post SCT short-term recovery. Six attributes with varying levels, including fever, lack of energy, problems with daily function, anxiety/depression, blood transfusions, and hospitalization, were used to define health states. An online survey using discrete choice experiment methodology was designed to capture preferences for health status scenarios including the identified attributes and key grade 3/4 chemotherapy-related SAEs. Health state utilities and SAE disutilities were generated from a conditional logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. Results: Of the 300 survey participants, the demographic distributions were within a 3% margin of those in the 2010 US Census. CR had the highest utility value (0.875), followed by post-SCT short-term recovery (0.398), relapse (0.355), no CR (0.262), and SCT (0.158). Of the SAEs, serious infection had the highest decline in utility (0218), followed by severe diarrhea (0.176), abnormally low blood cell counts (0.100), and severe redness/skin peeling (0.060). Conclusions: AML and treatments can result in reduced quality of life and impaired ability to perform daily activities. Findings of this study underline the value that society places on treatment-related AML health states and SAEs.","[Stein, Eytan M.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Yang, Min; Gao, Wei; Galebach, Philip; Xiang, Cheryl Q.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Guerin, Annie] Anal Grp Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bhattacharyya, Subrata] Novartis Healthcare Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Bonifacio, Gaetano; Joseph, George J.] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA","Yang, M (corresponding author), Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA.",min.yang@analysisgroup.com,,,Novartis Pharmaceuticals CorporationNovartis,Funding for this research was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

It implies mobile storages that could - during long phases of immobility - provide services for the electricity sector. However, this technical option - called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) - requires the vehicle users to temporarily abstain from the usage of their batteries for V2G. A reasonable estimate of the potential of V2G thus considers which individual, technical and economic parameters are decisive for the willingness of vehicle users to participate. To answer these questions a representative sample of vehicle users in Germany has been surveyed - including a discrete choice experiment. 'Range anxiety' and the 'minimum range' proved most important determinants of the willingness of vehicle users to participate in V2G. If these concerns are smoothed out, even without remuneration, high participation rates might be achieved. To increase the participation in the V2G technology, the transition from 'tank control' to 'mobility demand articulation' should be facilitated for vehicle users. Therefore, companies could tailor the V2G design to customers' needs and policy could improve information about V2G.

The conditions are substantially different in African countries where poverty and lack of life-supporting services prevail. The provision of domestic water is an essential problem, which requires action. he lack of sufficient funding for the development of infrastructure supports claims for citizen participation in related costs. However, can citizens pay and to what extend for sufficient water provision? The present study investigates a household's willingness to pay for domestic water in the transboundary Mekrou River Basin in West Africa (Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger) and explores the payment for domestic water provision to poverty. The paper uses the results of a household survey that was undertaken in the Mekrou basin including a representative sample from all three countries. Based on this survey the paper presents basic socio-economic characteristics of the local population as well as qualitative water provision and management attributes. In the core of the econometric analysis the paper presents the results of the survey's Contingent Valuation (CV) scenario estimating the households' willingness to pay (WTP) for a domestic water provision. The households of the Mekrou basin are willing to pay 2.81 euro per month in average for a domestic water provision network but this is strongly related with the wealth of households. This finding although it may support the user pays principle, it also raises serious questions over the provision of water to poor households.","[Trichakis, Ioannis; Moreno, Cesar Carmona] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Latinopoulos, Dionysis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Bithas, Kostas] Pante Univ, Inst Urban Environm & Human Resources, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 14 Aristotelous St, GR-17671 Athens, Greece; [M'Po, Yekambessoun N'Tcha] UAC, INE, 01 BP 4521, Cotonou, Benin","Markantonis, V (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",vmarkantonis@gmail.com; celeri28@gmail.com; greecedlatinop@plandevel.auth.gr; kbithas@panteion.gr; trichakis@gmail.com; ntcha_mpo@yahoo.fr; cesar.carmona-moreno@ec.europa.eu,"Trichakis, Ioannis/W-8352-2019","Trichakis, Ioannis/0000-0002-1463-8625; Latinopoulos, DIONYSIS/0000-0003-2184-9268; BITHAS, KOSTAS/0000-0001-6544-7557; N'TCHA M'PO, Yekambessoun/0000-0001-5160-8495","European Commission, DG DEVCO ProjectEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre","Funded by the European Commission, DG DEVCO Project Water for Growth and Poverty Reduction in the Mekrou.",,38,1,1,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,1232,10.3390/w10091232,,,27,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GY7UR,WOS:000448821900124,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-07-05,

Abstract Dogs are a popular companion animal in the United States; however, dog acquisition is often a contentious subject. Adoption is often cited as an ethical and popular method of acquisition but interpretation of the term adoption' may vary. In a nationally representative survey of the U.S., 767 respondents were asked questions regarding their opinions of dog acquisition and adoption. Within the sample, 45% had a dog; of those, 40% had adopted a dog, and 47% visited a veterinarian once a year. A best-worst choice experiment, where respondents were asked to choose the most ethical and least ethical method of acquiring a dog from a statistically determined set of choices, was used to elicit respondents' preferences for the most ethical method of dog adoption. A random parameters logit and a latent class model were used to estimate relative rankings of dog adoption methods. In the random parameters logit model, the largest preference share was for adoption from a municipal animal shelter (56%) and the smallest preference share was for adoption from a pet store (3%).

On the basis of more than 50 choices on each of the 3160 pairs, we estimated EQ-5D-5L values on a QALY scale and compared them with the US EQ-5D-3L values and the other country-specific EQ-5D-5L values. Results: Ranging from -0.287 (55555) to 0.992 (11121) on a QALY scale, the estimated EQ-5D-5L values were similar to the US EQ-5D-3L values. Compared with the US EQ-5D-3L values, the values exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity and higher correlation with the EQ-5D-5L values of other countries, particularly England. Conclusions: Like previous US valuation studies, this study produced nationally representative EQ-5D-5L values on a QALY scale. The results further demonstrate the advantages of the EQ-5D-5L over its 3-level predecessor as a preference-based summary measure of health-related quality of life from the perspective of US adults.","[Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, 4202 E Fowler Ave,CMC206A, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Rand, Kim] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Rand, Kim] Akershus Univ Hosp, Hlth Serv Res Ctr, Lorenskog, Norway","Craig, BM (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, 4202 E Fowler Ave,CMC206A, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",bcraig@usf.edu,,"Rand, Kim/0000-0001-7692-4099","EuroQol Research Foundation; National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, through the National Cancer Institute [1R01CA160104]","Supported by the EuroQol Research Foundation and a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, through the National Cancer Institute (1R01CA160104).

Methods: We conducted person trade-off (PTO) and discrete choice experiment (DCE) among 3950 adults selected to be representative of the UK general population. Experimental design was informed by surveys of patients affected by rare diseases, their caregivers, health care staff, and policymakers. Societal preferences were estimated in relation to treating a common disease, increases in waiting lists, or filling of vacant NHS posts. Results of the DCE were applied to recently licensed orphan drugs. Results: On the basis of equal cost, the majority of respondents to the PTO (54%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 50-59) chose to allocate funds equally between patients treated for rare diseases and those treated for common diseases, with 32% (95% CI 28-36) favoring treating rare diseases over treating common diseases (14%; 95% CI 11-17), which this reduced to 23% (95% CI 20-27) when rare disease treatments were 10 times more expensive. When framed differently, more respondents prioritized not increasing waiting list size (43%; 95% CI 39-48) than to treat rare disease patients (34%; 95% CI 30-38). Discussion: The DCE indicated a greater preference for treating a common disease over a rare disease. Respondents agreed with five of 12 positive appraisal recommendations for orphan drugs, even if their list price was higher, but preferred the NHS not to fund the remainder. Conclusions: The general public does not value rarity as a sufficient reason to justify special consideration for additional NHS funding of orphan drugs. This has implications regarding the appropriateness of operating higher thresholds of cost-effectiveness.","[Bourke, Siobhan M.; Plumpton, Catrin O.; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Normal Site,Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales","Hughes, DA (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Normal Site,Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Plumpton, Catrin/0000-0003-2710-9199; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459",Medical Research Council North West Hub in Trial Methodological Research (NWHTMR) [MR/K025635/1],"DAH received funding from the Medical Research Council North West Hub in Trial Methodological Research (NWHTMR) (MR/K025635/1) and received a Health and Care Research Wales Senior Research Leader award.

Methods: Patients with epilepsy (>18 years, treated with AEDs) and neurologists were recruited from nationally representative US panels to complete an online survey that included a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Participants chose between two hypothetical AEDs, characterized by six attributes in the DCE, which included 1) level of seizure control/reduction; 2) closing frequency, 3) diminished coordination and balance, 4) psychiatric issues, 5) diminished energy level, and 6) dietary restrictions. The Sawtooth Software Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) System for CBC Analysis was used to estimate treatment attribute ranking and weighting. Results: Of the 720 respondents (518 patients and 202 neurologists), both patients and neurologists ranked seizure control as the most important attribute (rank 1) and dietary restrictions as the least important attribute (rank 6). However, seizure control had a significantly greater weighting in neurologists decision-making than among patients (45% vs 32%, p < 0.005). On the other hand, patients considered the risks of psychiatric adverse effects (19% vs 15%), diminished coordination and balance (16% vs 10%), and fatigue or diminished energy (13% vs 11%) as significantly more important (p < 0.05) than did neurologists. Conclusion: Patients and neurologists had similar preference ranking order, with seizure reduction being ranked the most important attribute. However, neurologist treatment preferences were significantly more influenced by seizure reduction while patient preferences were significantly more influenced by adverse effects that may impact their quality of life. Understanding how patient and neurologist perspectives differ should encourage dialog to communicate the potential risks and benefits of AED therapy and assist in the shared decision-making process.

This paper develops, validates and applies a novel modelling framework for explaining renovation decisions, with an emphasis on energy-efficiency measures. The framework is tested using quantitative data from a nationally-representative survey of owner-occupied households in the UK (n = 1028). The modelling advances formal representations of renovation decisions by including background conditions of domestic life to which renovating is an adaptive response. Path analysis confirms that three conditions of domestic life are particularly influential on renovation decisions: balancing competing commitments for how space at home is used; signalling identity through homemaking activities; and managing physical vulnerabilities of household members. These conditions of domestic life also capture the influence of property characteristics (age, type) and household characteristics (size, composition, length of tenure) on renovation decisions but with greater descriptive realism. Multivariate probit models are used to provide rigorous, transparent and analytically tractable representations of the full renovation decision process. Model fits to the representative national sample of UK homeowners are good. The modelling shows that renovation intentions emerge initially from certain conditions of domestic life, at which point energy efficiency is not a distinctive type of renovation. The modelling also shows clearly that influences on renovation decisions change through the decision process. This has important implications for policy and service providers. Efficiency measures should be bundled into broader types of home improvements, and incentives should target the underlying reasons why homeowners decide to renovate in the first place.","[Wilson, C.; Pettifor, H.] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Chryssochoidis, G.] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England","Wilson, C (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",charlie.wilson@uea.ac.uk,"George Chryssochoidis- Professor of Marketing, University of Kent/I-1285-2019; Chryssochoidis, George/T-6139-2017; Pettifor, Hazel/AAF-6393-2020","George Chryssochoidis- Professor of Marketing, University of Kent/0000-0001-9868-7119; Chryssochoidis, George/0000-0001-9868-7119; Pettifor, Hazel/0000-0003-3901-2693; Wilson, Charlie/0000-0001-8164-3566",UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) [NE/J006017/1],This work was funded by the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) through grant NE/J006017/1.

These arrangements redistribute collectively financed resources to ensure access to health care for all. Allocation of health services is historically based on medical needs, but use of other criteria, such as lifestyle, is debated upon. Does the general public also have preferences for conditional allocation? This depends on their opinions regarding deservingness. The aim of this study was to gain insight in those opinions, specifically by examining the perceived weight of different criteria in allocation decisions. Based on literature and expert interviews, we included 5 criteria in a discrete choice experiment: need, financial capacity, lifestyle, cooperation with treatment, and package/premium choice. A representative sample of the Dutch population was invited to participate (n = 10760). A total of 774 people accessed the questionnaire (7.2%), of whom 375 completed it (48.4%). Medical need was overall the most important criterion in determining deservingness (range beta = 1.60). Perceived deservingness decreased if claimants had higher financial capacity (1.26) and unhealthier lifestyle (1.04), if their cooperation was less optimal (1.05), or if they had opted for less insurance coverage (0.56). However, preferences vary among respondents, in relation to demographic and ideological factors.","[van der Aa, Maartje J.; Paulus, Aggie T. G.; Hiligsmann, Mickael J. C.; Maarse, Johannes A.

Taking preventive health care measures or purchasing a private health insurance are examples of decisions individuals make based on their preferences. This study analysed the relationship between health condition and behaviour under conditions of uncertainty and examined personal characteristics related to risk behaviour. Data was obtained from a survey on a representative sample of the Dutch adult population (n=2,822) conducted between May and June of 2014. Risk attitude was assessed through a self-reported scale and risk behaviours through a simulated lottery game, both included in the same survey. The relationship between risk attitudes and behaviours was examined, as well as certain socio-economic variables, including health condition, demographic characteristics, social status, and confidence in government institutions. Surveyed participants perceived themselves as risk-avoiding. However, their behaviour tended to be risk-seeking when playing lottery games, even when they faced potential (but limited) economic losses. Participants with poorer mental health condition tended to be less risk-inclined, which was not the case for participants who reported poor general health status. Participants feeling a higher satisfaction with their lives were willing to take greater risks in the lottery games. These findings allow for understanding risk behaviour as the interaction between personal perception of risk attitude and the assessment of risk associated to a specific situation. This assessment may be directly modulated by one's state of mind and not by physical health condition.","[Martin-Fernandez, Jesus] Madrid Hlth Serv, Villamanta Clin, Primary Healthcare Management, Navalcarnero Hlth Ctr, Madrid, Spain; [Martin-Fernandez, Jesus] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Hlth Sci Fac, Madrid, Spain; [Martin-Fernandez, Jesus; Ariza-Cardiel, Gloria; Polentinos-Castro, Elena] Hlth Serv Res Network Chron Dis REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain; [Medina-Palomino, Hector J.] Stichting Medina Care, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ariza-Cardiel, Gloria; Polentinos-Castro, Elena] Madrid Hlth Serv, Multiprofess Teaching Unit Primary & Community Ca, Primary Healthcare Management, Madrid, Spain; [Rutkowski, Anne] Tilburg Univ, Dept Management, Tilburg, Netherlands","Martin-Fernandez, J (corresponding author), Madrid Hlth Serv, Villamanta Clin, Primary Healthcare Management, Navalcarnero Hlth Ctr, Madrid, Spain.; Martin-Fernandez, J (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Hlth Sci Fac, Madrid, Spain.; Martin-Fernandez, J (corresponding author), Hlth Serv Res Network Chron Dis REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain.",jmfernandez@salud.madrid.org,"Martin-Fernandez, Jesus/U-1006-2019; POLENTINOS-CASTRO, ELENA/B-7373-2019","Martin-Fernandez, Jesus/0000-0001-9545-1549; ARIZA-CARDIEL, GLORIA/0000-0002-4635-9604; POLENTINOS-CASTRO, ELENA/0000-0001-9460-2966",FIIBAP (Fundacion para la Investigacion e Innovacion Biomedica en Atencion Primaria),This work was partially supported by the FIIBAP (Fundacion para la Investigacion e Innovacion Biomedica en Atencion Primaria) [Call for Aid for translations & publications 2016].,,61,1,1,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-8575,1469-8331,,HEALTH RISK SOC,Health Risk Soc.,,2018,20,3-4,,,,,126,146,,10.1080/13698575.2018.1458976,,,21,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Social Sciences, Biomedical","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Biomedical Social Sciences",GO3JH,WOS:000439885200002,,,,,2021-07-05,

OBJECTIVES: To elicit women's trade-offs between the benefits and harms of BC screening and to analyze the main determinants of these trade-offs. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment with seven attributes depicting BC screening programs including varying levels of BC mortality, overdiagnosis, and false-positive result was used. Eight hundred twelve women aged 40 to 74 years with no personal history of BC recruited by a survey institute and representative of the French general population (age, socioeconomic level, and geographical location) completed the discrete-choice experiment. Preference heterogeneity was investigated using generalized multinomial logit models from which individual trade-offs were derived, and their main determinants were assessed using generalized linear models. Screening acceptance rates under various benefits and harms ratios were simulated on the basis of the distribution of individual preferences. RESULTS: The women would be willing to accept on average 14.1 overdiagnosis cases (median = 9.6) and 47.8 false-positive results (median = 27.2) to avoid one BC-related death. After accounting for preference heterogeneity, less than 50% of women would be willing to accept 10 overdiagnosis cases for one BC-related death avoided. Screening acceptance rates were higher among women with higher socioeconomic level and lower among women with poor health. CONCLUSIONS: Women are sensitive to both the benefits and the harms of BC screening and their preferences are highly heterogeneous. Our study provides useful results for public health authorities and clinicians willing to improve their recommendations of BC screening on the basis of women's preferences.

We address the question of the acceptability of cost-effective climate policy in a real-voting setting. First, we analyze voting behavior in a large ballot on energy taxes, rejected in Switzerland in 2015 by more than 2 million people. Energy taxes were aimed at completely replacing the current value-added tax. We examine the determinants of voting and find that distributional and competitiveness concerns reduced the acceptability of energy taxes, along with the perception of ineffectiveness. Most people would have preferred tax revenues to be allocated for environmental purposes. Second, at the same time of the ballot, we tested the acceptability of alternative designs of a carbon tax with a choice experiment survey on a representative sample of the Swiss population. Survey respondents are informed about environmental, distributional and competitiveness effects of each carbon tax design. These impacts are estimated with a computable general equilibrium model. This original setting generates a series of novel results. Providing information on the expected environmental effectiveness of carbon taxes reduces the demand for environmental earmarking. Making distributional effects salient generates an important demand for progressive designs, e.g. social cushioning or recycling via lump-sum transfers. The case of lump-sum recycling is particularly striking: it is sufficient to show its desirable distributional properties to make it one of the most preferred designs, which corresponds to a completely novel result in the literature. We show that providing detailed information on the functioning of environmental taxes may contribute to close both the gap between acceptability ex ante and ex post and the gap between economists' prescriptions and the preferences of the general public.","[Carattini, Stefano] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Carattini, Stefano] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Carattini, Stefano] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London, England; [Baranzini, Andrea] HES SO Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Carouge, Switzerland; [Thalmann, Philippe; Vohringer, Frank] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Varone, Frederic] Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Geneva, Switzerland","Carattini, S (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.; Carattini, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.; Carattini, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London, England.",s.carattini@lse.ac.uk,"Thalmann, Philippe/A-6943-2008; Baranzini, Andrea/R-6506-2019; Carattini, Stefano/AAK-5053-2021","Thalmann, Philippe/0000-0001-7200-3241; Baranzini, Andrea/0000-0002-9438-7730; Carattini, Stefano/0000-0003-1242-2457","Swiss Federal Office of Energy; COST Action Innovations in Climate Governance: Sources, Patterns and Effects (INOGOV) [IS1309]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [P2SKP1_165028]","The authors thank Sam Fankhauser, Anthony Leiserowitz and Boris Krey as well as the editors of this special issue, Cees Withagen, Gerard van der Meijden, and Rick van der Ploeg, for providing very valuable feedback.

We used a discrete choice experiment to quantify preferences of Australians for a migratory shorebird offset in the context of an oil and gas development project. We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1371 respondents on their preferences for current and prospective offset-policy characteristics via an online questionnaire to inform policy design of the social dimensions related to offset acceptability. The majority of respondents accepted offsetting as a means to allow economic development; the option to reject development (and an offset) was selected in 13% of possible offset scenarios. Substituting protection of a species affected by the development with protection of a more endangered species was a desirable policy characteristic, as was having the offset implemented by a third party or the government rather than the company responsible for the development. Direct offset activities (e.g., improving degraded habitat) were preferred over indirect activities (e.g., a research program), and respondents were strongly against locating the offset at a site other than where the impact occurred. Positive and negative characteristics of offsets could be traded off by changing the number of birds protected by the offset. Our results show that Australians are likely to support increased flexibility in biodiversity-offset policies, particularly when undesirable policy characteristics are compensated for.","[Rogers, Abbie A.; Burton, Michael P.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, M089,35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Rogers, Abbie A.; Burton, Michael P.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, M470,35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Rogers, AA (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, M089,35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Rogers, AA (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, M470,35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",abbie.rogers@uwa.edu.au,"; Rogers, Abbie/H-5739-2014","burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093; Rogers, Abbie/0000-0002-7611-7593",Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program Marine Biodiversity HubAustralian Government; Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Environmental DecisionsAustralian Research Council,The Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program Marine Biodiversity Hub and the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions are acknowledged for their funding and support.,,27,6,6,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

The impact of empathic abilities on decision-making is considered an important research question, as our knowledge remains limited as to the importance of personal ability on decisions. The article further contributes to the field of street-level bureaucracy by conducting a discrete choice experiment, an approach highly suitable for examining discretionary decision-making. The article draws on nationally representative survey data from 268 employees in correctional facilities in Denmark, with a 67.5% response rate. The findings confirm that discretionary decision-making is affected by the empathic abilities of bureaucrats. However, the impact of empathy depends on the severity of inmates' infringement against the rules. In essence, the findings demonstrate that personal abilities may advantageously be incorporated into further studies as an important determinant of street-level behavior.","[Jensen, Didde Cramer] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Jensen, Didde Cramer] SFI, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Pedersen, Line Bjornskov] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark","Jensen, DC (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.; Jensen, DC (corresponding author), SFI, Copenhagen, Denmark.",dcj@sfi.dk,,"Pedersen, Line Bjornskov/0000-0001-6804-2045",,,,138,16,16,3,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1053-1858,1477-9803,,J PUBL ADM RES THEOR,J.

This study investigates the effect of point-of-purchase actions; price changes, health and/or environment logos, health and/or environment product information labels. Three hypothetical choice experiments investigated choices between specific products and their healthy and sustainable alternatives: rice (white versus brown rice, n = 280), meat (beef versus kangaroo steak, n = 344) and tomatoes (tinned versus fresh tomatoes for a tomato sauce, n = 320). Data was collected via an online survey from a representative nationwide sample of Australian household grocery buyers (N = 944). Results show that the effects of the investigated actions are very product and consumer segment dependent. In general, price changes, particularly a decreased price (subsidy) for the healthy and sustainable alternatives, had a bigger effect on shifting choices than did a logo and/or label. Product similarity seems to play an important role as we observed the greatest shift in choices in the rice experiment with more respondents opting for brown rice instead of white rice. The responsiveness of consumers to the investigated measures was largely influenced by whether they were familiar with, and liked, the healthy and sustainable product alternative. In conclusion this study indicates that point-of-purchase actions may partially contribute to advance uptake of healthy and sustainable food alternatives. The effects of such measures are expected to be greater when these alternatives are more similar to the standard products for their sensory properties, convenience, product liking and familiarity.

In particular, community views about the distribution or equity of funding across the population. These official committees and agencies often have access to the best available and latest evidence on clinical effectiveness, safety and cost from large clinical trials and population-based studies. All too often they do not have access to high quality evidence about community views. We therefore, conducted a large and representative population-based survey in Australia to determine what community members think about the factors that do and should influence government spending on prescribed medicines. Methods A choice-based survey was designed to elicit the importance of individual criteria when considering the equity of government spending on prescribed medicines. A representative sample of 3080 adult Australians completed the survey by allocating a hypothetical budget to different combinations of money spent on two patient populations. Societal preferences were inferred from absolute majority responses i.e. populations with more than 50% of respondents' allocation for a particular allocation criterion. Results This study shows that, all else being equal, severity of disease, diseases for which there is no alternative treatment available on the government formulary, diseases that affect patients who are not financially well off, and life-style unrelated diseases are supported by the public as resource allocation criteria. Where 'all else is not equal', participants allocated more resources to the patient population that gained considerable improvement in health and fewer resources to those that gained little improvement in health. This result held under all scenarios except for 'end-of-life treatments'. Responses to cost (and corresponding number of patients treated) trade-off scenarios indicated a significant reduction in the proportion of respondents choosing to divide resources equally and a shift in preference towards devoting resources to the population that were more costly to treat for all criteria with the exception of severity of disease. Conclusions The general public have clear views on what's fair in terms of government spending on prescribed medicines. In addition to supporting the application of the 'rule of rescue', important considerations for government spending included the severity of disease being treated, diseases for which there is no alternative treatment available on the government formulary, diseases that affect patients who are not financially well off and life-style unrelated diseases. This study shows that the general public are willing to share their views on what constitutes an equitable allocation of the government's drug budget. The challenge remains to how best to consider those views alongside clinical and economic considerations.","[Chim, Lesley; Kelly, Patrick] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Chim, Lesley] Alex Pharmaceut, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Salkeld, Glenn] Univ Wollongong, Fac Social Sci, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Lipworth, Wendy] Univ Sydney, Ctr Values Eth & Law Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Bangor Inst Hlth & Med Res, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Stockler, Martin R.] Univ Sydney, NHMRC, Clin Trials Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Stockler, Martin R.] Concord Hosp, Concord Canc Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Stockler, Martin R.] Chris OBrien Lifehouse, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Chim, L (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Chim, L (corresponding author), Alex Pharmaceut, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",lesleychim@gmail.com,"; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Lipworth, Wendy/0000-0002-0234-657X; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459",National Health and Medical Research Council of AustraliaNational Health and Medical Research Council of AustraliaUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [6633003],"This study was undertaken as part of the Screening and Diagnostic Test Evaluation Program funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia under Program Grant number 6633003.

Using a between-subject choice experiment design, we investigate the effectiveness of message targeting and media delivery, including infographic and video treatments, on consumer stated recycling behavior of a plastic or boxboard sandwich container. We find that respondents viewed having to clean packaging, a requirement for many food products, as a barrier to recycling, but not the type of packaging material or the number of steps involved in recycling the product. Individuals drawn to recycling for energy conservation reasons were less likely to view cleaning as a barrier.

Claims data were used for the analyses of direct and indirect costs reduction. A discrete choice experiment based on a web-based survey estimated the monetary value of the intangible costs for one injection. Another web-based survey of prostate cancer patients, who had received treatment with leuprorelin acetate injections, was carried out to calibrate the results of the discrete choice experiment.Results: Reductions in medical costs and loss of productivity for having one less injection in prostate cancer patients receiving leuprorelin acetate were JPY 5,670 and JPY 1,723, respectively. Intangible costs saved by using a 6-month depot formulation instead of a 3-month depot formulation for the injection of leuprorelin acetate were estimated to be JPY 19,872, including the values for a reduction in pain (JPY 3,131), injection site reactions (JPY 11,545), waiting time (JPY 9,479), and subtracting the value of medical consultation (JPY 4,283).

Methods: A targeted literature review and seven one-to-one interviews with physicians and imaging center directors were conducted to identify attributes that could impact physicians' referral decisions. The impact of the identified attributes was assessed via an online discrete choice survey among eligible PCPs and cardiologists randomly selected from a nationally representative panel, and quantified with an odds ratio (OR) scale estimated with a multivariable logistic regression. Results: Nine two-level attributes were identified: ease of the referral process, waiting time for tests, insurance preauthorization assistance, time to receive results, conclusive test reports, patient satisfaction, a protocol for rapid conversion from an exercise to a pharmacological stress test, patient communication, and assistance with parking/wheelchair access. A total of 410 physicians, including 208 (50.7%) cardiologists and 202 (49.3%) PCPs completed the survey. Among all physicians, a protocol that allows for a rapid conversion from an exercise to a pharmacological stress test (OR=2.9) and preauthorization assistance (OR=2.6) were the most impactful attributes. Additionally, cardiologists preferred imaging centers that provide an easy referral process (OR=2.7), while PCPs favored centers offering a conclusive test report (OR=2.4). Limitations: Some center features that might impact physician referral decision were not evaluated in this study, if they were not easily changeable from an imaging center's perspective. Conclusions: The availability of a protocol for rapid conversion from an exercise to a pharmacological stress test and preauthorization assistance had the most significant impact on physician referral decisions for SPECT-MPI.

Method A survey was carried out in Bulgaria among a nationally representative sample of 1003 respondents. Both a discrete choice experiment and a self-explicated ranking of outpatient and inpatient service attributes were included in the survey. The data are analyzed to elicit the preferences of Bulgarian healthcare consumers for service attributes and to compare them with previous studies in Bulgaria and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Results The reputation and skills of the care provider appear to be relatively most important to the respondents, followed by the state of the equipment, the condition of the facility and the attitude of the staff. The fee-level and access-related attributes (waiting and traveling time) emerged as less important. Overall, consumers in Bulgaria value the quality of healthcare provision very highly. Yet, there are some statistically significant differences between sociodemographic groups. Conclusion In general, Bulgarian healthcare consumers are willing to accept higher prices for the services they use, when this comes with improved quality of services.

Effective enzyme replacement therapies are available that are administered intravenously. However, a new oral treatment is being developed as an alternative option for patients with amenable mutations. This study was designed to understand the value that people place on the different features of treatments for Fabry disease. Research design and methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed to assess the importance of different aspects of treatments for Fabry disease. The attributes included overall survival, mode of administration, treatment related reactions, treatment related headaches and risk of antibody formation. Attributes were combined using a published orthogonal array into choice sets. A research panel was used to survey the UK general public. The mixed logit model was used to estimate strength of preference for the attributes and marginal rates of substitution (MRSs). Disutilities were estimated from the DCE data for changes in each attribute. Results: The sample (n=506) was broadly representative of UK demographics. The logit model revealed that all attributes were significant predictors of choice. Participants were significantly more likely to choose a treatment which meant an increase in their life expectancy by 1 year (odds ratio = 1.574; 95% CI = 1.504-1.647) and significantly less likely to choose self-administered intravenous (IV) treatment compared to an every other day tablet (OR = 0.426 95% CI = 0.384-0.474). Estimated disutilities were 0.0543 (self-administered infusion), treatment related headaches 12 times a year (-0.0361) and infusion reactions six times a year (-0.0202). Conclusions: The survey revealed a significant preference for oral treatment compared with IV even in the context of a treatment that can extend overall survival. MRSs were used as a basis for estimating disutilities associated with changes in attribute levels which could be used to weight QALYs. It is possible that other important treatment attributes are missing from this research which may have provided further insights. It would also be useful to extend this research to include Fabry disease patients so their preferences can be assessed against the societal perspective.","[Lloyd, Andrew J.] Bladon Associates Ltd, Oxford, England; [Gallop, Katy] Bladon Associates Ltd, Bristol, Avon, England; [Ali, Shehzad] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Hughes, Derralynn] Royal Free Hosp, London, England; [MacCulloch, Alasdair] Amicus Therapeut Ltd, London, England","Lloyd, AJ (corresponding author), 3 Kings Meadow, Oxford, England.",Andrew@bladonassoc.com,"hughes, derralynn/J-8012-2013","hughes, derralynn/0000-0003-4531-9173",Amicus Therapeutics Inc.,This project was supported by Amicus Therapeutics Inc.,,12,2,2,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0300-7995,1473-4877,,CURR MED RES OPIN,Curr.

However, researchers and policy makers seem to neglect a key issue: pinpoint policies are the most important, which means niche targeting is the premise before any policy design, such that better knowing of the livestock farmers preference is prerequisite. This paper then analyzes this question using a method of choice experiment to elicit the farmers' preference and valuation of livestock pollution control policy instruments at household-scale, medium-scale and large-scale farms. Five attributes (technology regulation, pollution charge, biogas subsidy, manure price, and information provisioning) were set as livestock pollution control policy instruments. In total, 754 pigs farmers from five representative provinces in China were surveyed, and the collected data were analyzed using random parameter logit models. The marginal substitution rates for attributes are estimated both with preference space approach and willingness to pay space approach. The results show significant heterogeneities in farmers' preferences and valuations for livestock pollution control policy instruments within the three scales. All policy instruments effectively increased the manure eco-friendly treatment ratio for medium-scale farms, and household-scale farms showed little change in the manure eco-friendly treatment ratio under all policy instruments. Household-scale farms and medium-scale farms suggested the highest preference for the biogas subsidy policy, while large-scale farms suggested the highest preference for the manure price policy.","[Pan, Dan] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China","Pan, D (corresponding author), Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China.",pandan@jxufe.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71303099, 71503113, 71263018]; Education Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [General 30]; National Social Science Foundation of China [2015YZD16, 15CGL039]; Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [JJ1510]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20152ACB20004]","We would like to thank the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71303099; No. 71503113; and No. 71263018), the Education Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. General 30), the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 2015YZD16; and No. 15CGL039), the Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. JJ1510) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. 20152ACB20004).",,46,7,7,0,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2016,8,7,,,,,,,611,10.3390/su8070611,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DS4OM,WOS:000380760400022,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-07-05,

Imprecision in estimates of benefits and harms around treatment choices is rarely described to patients. Variation in sampling error between treatment alternatives (e.g., treatments have similar average risks, but one treatment has a larger confidence interval) can result in patients failing to choose the option that is best for them. The aim of this study is to use a discrete choice experiment to describe how 2 methods for conveying imprecision in risk influence people's treatment decisions. Methods. We randomized a representative sample of the Canadian general population to 1 of 3 surveys that sought choices between hypothetical treatments for rheumatoid arthritis based on different levels of 7 attributes: route and frequency of administration, chance of benefit, serious and minor side effects and life expectancy, and imprecision in benefit and side-effect estimates. The surveys differed in the way imprecision was described: 1) no imprecision, 2) quantitative description based on a range with a visual graphic, and 3) qualitative description simply describing the confidence in the evidence. Results. The analyzed data were from 2663 respondents. Results suggested that more people understood imprecision when it was described qualitatively (88%) versus quantitatively (68%). Respondents who appeared to understand imprecision descriptions placed high value on increased precision regarding the actual benefits and harms of treatment, equivalent to the value placed on the information about the probability of serious side effects. Both qualitative and quantitative methods led to small but significant increases in decision uncertainty for choosing any treatment. Limitations included some issues in defining understanding of imprecision and the use of an internet survey of panel members. Conclusions. These findings provide insight into how conveying imprecision information influences patient treatment choices.","[Bansback, Nick] St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada; [Bansback, Nick] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Harrison, Mark] Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Harrison, Mark] Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Marra, Carlo] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Sch Pharm, St John, NF, Canada","Bansback, N (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, 2206 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",nick.bansback@ubc.ca,"Marra, Carlo/AAE-4904-2021","Harrison, Mark/0000-0002-2115-2447; Bansback, Nick/0000-0002-1510-3462; Marra, Carlo/0000-0002-2625-2121",,,,43,13,13,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0272-989X,1552-681X,,MED DECIS MAKING,Med.

However, there is limited information available on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for specific forest ecosystem services, particularly across different ecosystem market mechanisms. We utilize survey data from Oregon and Washington households to compare marginal WTP for forest ecosystem services and the total WTP for cost-effective bundles of forest ecosystem services obtained from a typical Pacific Northwest forest across two value elicitation formats representing two different ecosystem market mechanisms: an incentive-compatible choice experiment involving mandatory tax payments and a hypothetical private provision scenario modeled as eliciting contributions to the preferred forest management alternative via a provision point mechanism with a refund. A representative household's total WTP for the average forest management program was estimated at $217.59 per household/year under a mandatory tax mechanism and $160.44 per household/per year under a voluntary, crowdfunding-style, contribution mechanism; however, these estimates are not statistically different. Marginal WTP estimates were assessed for particular forest ecosystem service attributes including water quality, carbon storage, mature forest habitat, and public recreational access. This study finds that survey respondents place significant economic value on forest ecosystem services in both elicitation formats and that the distributions of the marginal WTP are not statistically significantly different.","[Roesch-McNally, Gabrielle E.] Iowa State Univ, Sociol & Sustainable Agr, 339 Sci 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Rabotyagov, Sergey S.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Roesch-McNally, GE (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Sociol & Sustainable Agr, 339 Sci 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",geroesch@iastate.edu,,,U.S. National Institute of Food and Agriculture [WNZ-1398],"We thank the U.S. National Institute of Food and Agriculture for providing the financial support for this research through Grant WNZ-1398.

Our objective was to quantify the preferences of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for reducing the frequency of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist injections from once daily to once weekly. Methods: A total of 643 respondents with a self-reported physician diagnosis of type 2 diabetes completed a web-based discrete-choice experiment survey. The sample included four prespecified subgroups: currently using exenatide once weekly (n = 150), liraglutide once daily (n = 153), insulin (but not exenatide once weekly or liraglutide) (n = 156), and no injectable treatment (n = 184). Device attributes included type of injection device, needle size and pain, injection frequency, refrigeration, and injection-site reactions. Random-parameters logit was used to estimate the relative impact of device attributes on treatment choice for each subgroup. Results: In all subgroups, changing injection frequency from daily to weekly (independent of the effect of injection frequency on preferences for other attributes) was the most important predictor of treatment choice. Switching from a longer and thicker needle to a shorter and thinner needle and eliminating injection-site reactions were also statistically significant predictors of device choice (P<0.05). Exenatide once weekly users and those not currently using injections were more likely to choose a treatment with characteristics similar to exenatide once weekly. Conclusions: The treatment attribute most important to patients choosing among hypothetical injectable treatments for T2DM was injection frequency: patients preferred weekly over daily injections. Limitations: The primary limitations of this study are that it included only a limited number of attributes that may not reflect the full complexity of patient choices, diagnosis was self-reported, and patients were recruited from an Internet panel and may not be representative of the T2DM patient population.","[Hauber, A.

Recent proposals for value-based assessment, made by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, recommended that burden of illness (BOI) should replace end of life (EOL) as a factor for consideration when deciding on new health technologies. This article reports on a study eliciting societal preferences for 1) BOI from a medical condition, defined as quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss due to premature mortality and prospective morbidity, and 2) EOL, defined as expected life expectancy of less than 2 years and expected life expectancy gain from new treatment of 3 months or more. Methods. A discrete choice experiment survey was conducted with an online UK general population sample. Respondents chose whether they thought the health service should treat patient group A or B: life expectancy and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) with current treatment or life expectancy and HRQOL gains from new treatment, respectively. These attributes were used to derive BOI, QALY gain, and EOL. The respondents' choices were analyzed using conditional logistic regression with a range of specifications examined, including BOI or EOL, QALY gain and QALY gain squared, and robustness. QALY weights were estimated. Results. The sample of 3669 respondents was representative of the UK population for age and sex. QALY gain had a positive and significant coefficient across all models. QALY gain squared term was negative and significant across all models, indicating a diminishing marginal social value from QALY gains. When included, the BOI coefficient was generally small, positive, and significant, but this was not consistent across the different life expectancy variants. EOL was always positive and significant. Conclusions. The social value of a QALY gain is not equal between recipients but depends on whether they are end of life, and it may depend on the prospective burden of illness.","[Rowen, Donna; Brazier, John; Mukuria, Clara; Keetharuth, Anju; Tsuchiya, Aki; Whyte, Sophie; Shackley, Phil] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Hole, Arne Risa; Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England","Brazier, J (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",j.e.brazier@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Keetharuth, Anju/AAF-6799-2020","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Hole, Arne Risa/0000-0002-9413-8101; Keetharuth, Anju/0000-0001-8889-6806; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109",Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health; Department of Health Policy Research Programme,"We are grateful to the survey respondents and to Gavin Roberts and Danny Palnoch from DH for their comments throughout this project.

This study investigates how important forest ecosystem services are from the point of view of the general population and experts, and how measures to promote ecological afforestation can be designed more effectively. The study area comprises the planning region West Saxony and parts of the catchment area of the river Mulde (Figure 1). Personal interviews with six representatives of different stakeholder groups were carried out to elicit the views of experts on the relevance of different ecosystem services. A survey among the general public was conducted to assess the demand for afforestation in terms of public preferences. Farmers who are the potential suppliers of additional forests were interviewed to better understand their preferences regarding the design of financial support measures for ecological afforestation. The surveys of the general public and farmers both centered on two choice experiments (see Table 1 and Figure 2 for an overview of the choice experiment conducted with members of the general public). The empirical results show that both experts and the general population view afforestation and its positive effects on ecosystem services as meaningful and desirable (see Table 2 and Figure 3 for results of the survey among the general public). In particular, the positive effects of afforestation on the retention and filtration of water are valued highly by the majority of citizens and experts. The farmer and expert surveys show that a range of options exist to improve the attractiveness of the financial support measure for the first afforestation of agricultural land. While the amount of financial support does play a significant role and needs to be high enough to compensate the opportunity costs of afforestation, other aspects of contract design, which are equally important, include the length of the contract, the option to return to agriculture on completion of the financial support period and the supply of technical assistance for the cultivation and management of the forest.","[Voelker, Marc; Lienhoop, Nele; Ring, Irene; Muehlner, Susanne] UFZ Helmholtz Zentrum Umweltforsch, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Voelker, Marc] Mahidol Univ, Inst Populat & Social Res, Phutthamonthon 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand","Volker, M (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Zentrum Umweltforsch, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.; Volker, M (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Inst Populat & Social Res, Phutthamonthon 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.",marc.voe@mahidol.edu,,,,,,28,0,0,0,9,J D SAUERLAENDERS VERLAG,BAD ORB,"BERLINER STRASSE 46, 63619 BAD ORB, GERMANY",0002-5852,,,ALLG FORST JAGDZTG,Allg.

Design: Survey-based BWS experiment and discrete choice modelling. Setting: The UK. Participants: Current and recent UK Medical Research Council grant holders and a representative sample of the general public recruited from an online panel. Results: In relation to the study's 2 objectives: (1) we demonstrate the application of BWS methodology in the quantitative assessment and valuation of research impact. (2) The general public and researchers provided similar valuations for research impacts such as improved life expectancy, job creation and reduced health costs, but there was less agreement between the groups on other impacts, including commercial capacity development, training and dissemination. Conclusions: This is the second time that a discrete choice experiment has been used to assess how the general public and researchers value different types of research impact, and the first time that BWS has been used to elicit these choices. While the 2 groups value different research impacts in different ways, we note that where they agree, this is generally about matters that are seemingly more important and associated with wider social benefit, rather than impacts occurring within the research system. These findings are a first step in exploring how the beneficiaries and producers of research value different kinds of impact, an important consideration given the growing emphasis on funding and assessing research on the basis of (potential) impact. Future research should refine and replicate both the current study and that of Miller et al in other countries and disciplines.","[Pollitt, Alexandra; Grant, Jonathan] Kings Coll London, Policy Inst, London, England; [Potoglou, Dimitris] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Patil, Sunil; Burge, Peter; Guthrie, Susan; King, Suzanne; Wooding, Steven] RAND Europe, Westbrook Ctr, Cambridge, England","Grant, J (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Policy Inst, London, England.",jonathan.grant@kcl.ac.uk,"Potoglou, Dimitris/AAL-6813-2020; Grant, Jonathan/K-4282-2012","Potoglou, Dimitris/0000-0003-3060-7674; Patil, Sunil/0000-0003-1550-9718; Grant, Jonathan/0000-0002-1646-3486","UK MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MRC-MR/L010569/1-GRANT]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [MR/L010569/1, MR/L010569/2] Funding Source: researchfish",The authors are grateful for financial support from the UK MRC (grant number: MRC-MR/L010569/1-GRANT).,,28,14,14,0,1,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",2044-6055,,,BMJ OPEN,BMJ Open,,2016,6,8,,,,,,,e010916,10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010916,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DU6PI,WOS:000382336700118,27540096,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-05,

Within the sub-population of patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain, three groups were analyzed in depth: patients with neuropathic back pain, patients with painful diabetic polyneuropathy, and patients suffering from pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia. The central question was: On which features do patients base their assessment of pain medications and which features are most useful in the process of evaluating and selecting possible therapies? A detailed literature review, focus groups with patients, and face-to-face interviews with widely recognized experts for pain treatment were conducted to identify relevant treatment attributes of a pain medication. A pre-test was conducted to verify the structure of relevant and dominant attributes using factor analyses by evaluating the most frequently mentioned representatives of each factor. The Discrete-Choice Experiment (DCE) used a survey based on self-reported patient data including socio-demographics and specific parameters concerning pain treatment. Furthermore, the neuropathic pain component was determined in all patients based on their scoring in the painDETECT(A (R)) questionnaire. For statistical data analysis of the DCE, a random effect logit model was used and coefficients were presented. A total of 1,324 German patients participated in the survey, of whom 44 % suffered from neuropathic back pain (including mixed pain syndrome), 10 % complained about diabetic polyneuropathy, and 4 % reported pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia. A total of 36 single quality aspects of pain treatment, detected in the qualitative survey, were grouped in 7 dimensions by factor analysis. These 7 dimensions were used as attributes for the DCE. The DCE model resulted in the following ranking of relevant attributes for treatment decision: no character change, less nausea and vomiting, pain reduction (coefficient: > 0.9 for all attributes, high impact), rapid effect, low risk of addiction (coefficient similar to 0.5, middle impact), applicability with comorbidity (coefficient similar to 0.3), and improvement of quality of sleep (coefficient similar to 0.25). All attributes were highly significant (p < 0.001). The results were intended to enable early selection of an individualized pain medication. The results of the study showed that DCE is an appropriate means for the identification of patient preferences when being treated with specific pain medications. Due to the fact that pain perception is subjective in nature, the identification of patientsA ' preferences will enable therapists to better develop and implement patient-oriented treatment of chronic pain. It is therefore essential to improve the therapistsA ' understanding of patient preferences in order to make decisions concerning pain treatment. DCE and direct assessment should become valid instruments to elicit treatment preferences in chronic pain.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Juhnke, Christin] Hsch Neubrandenburg, IGM Inst Hlth Econ & Healthcare Management, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Nuebling, Matthias] GEB Empir Consulting MbH, Freiburg, Germany; [Junker, Uwe] Univ Cologne, Acad Teaching Hosp, Sana Klinikum Remscheid, Dept Anesthesiol Intens Care Med Pain Therapy & P, Remscheid, Germany; [Stemmler, Edgar] Pfizer Pharma GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Kohlmann, Thomas] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany; [Leverkus, Friedhelm] Pfizer Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany","Muhlbacher, AC (corresponding author), Hsch Neubrandenburg, IGM Inst Hlth Econ & Healthcare Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de,"Muhlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020; Juhnke, Christin/AAT-1479-2021","Muhlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211; Juhnke, Christin/0000-0002-3949-0612","Pfizer Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany; patient advocacy group Deutsche Schmerzliga e.V.","The authors extend their thanks to the patient advocacy group Deutsche Schmerzliga e.V. for their support in conducting this study.

Most of these landfills do not comply with European Union Directives. Recently, an incinerator project was abandoned due to strong opposition from various associations and civil society representatives. Opponents to the project put forward potential threats in terms of pollution. Our study applied a latent-class rank-ordered logit model to estimate marginal willingness-to-pay to decrease pollution associated with solid waste management, using data from a ranking choice experiment. It has long been recognized that the rank-ordered logit model provides efficiency gains, when compared to the basic multinomial logit model. However, respondents may not all be able to give a reliable complete ranking of the alternatives they face. In order to deal with the ranking capability issue and avoid noisy rankings which may result in biased estimates, we designed the survey that we conducted in Corsica in a way that allows the respondents to state their actual ranking capability. We suggest that this appropriate survey design may provide the information necessary to assess further the ranking capability issue within the framework of a latent-class rank-ordered logit model. Using rankings given by a representative sample of the Corsican population (530 respondents), we compare estimates obtained using a simple benchmark rank-ordered logit model and 2-class rank-ordered logit model chosen according to the BIC and the CAIC information criteria. We find strong differences in the willingness-to-pay to reduce the environmental impacts of waste management in Corsica for the two classes of respondents, which can be related to the stated ranking capability.","[Beaumais, Olivier; Prunetti, Dominique; Casabianca, Anne; Pieri, Xavier] Univ Corsica Pasquale Paoli, CNRS, LISA, UMR 6240, F-20250 Corte, France","Beaumais, O (corresponding author), Univ Corsica Pasquale Paoli, CNRS, LISA, UMR 6240, Campus Mariani,BP 52, F-20250 Corte, France.",olivier.beaumais@hotmail.fr,,,,,,41,4,4,0,17,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Consequently, stated-preference non-market valuation techniques, which recently emerged to mitigate these problems, are necessary to estimate economic weights for functional traits. The purpose of this paper is to present an example of the use of a choice experiment (CE) in the estimation of economic weights for sheep traits for the design of breeding goals. Through a questionnaire survey the preferences of sheep farmers are recorded and their marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for 10 production and functional traits is estimated. Data are analysed using random parameter logit models. The results reveal unobserved preference heterogeneity for fertility, adaptability to grazing and resistance to disease, thus highlighting that these traits are appreciated differently by farmers, because their needs are diverse. Positive MWTP is found for Greek breeds, high milk production and lambs with low fat deposition, for which there is high demand in Greek markets. On the other hand, MWTP for the cheese-making ability of milk is negative, stemming from the fact that sheep milk prices in Greece are not formulated according to milk composition. In addition, farmers seem to understand differences between udder shapes and attribute different values to various types. This application of the CE method indicates that communication channels among farmers and breeders should be established in order to enhance market performance and to provide orientation to the design of breeding programmes. Non-market valuation can be used complementarily to market valuation techniques, in order to provide accurate estimates for production and functional traits.","[Ragkos, A.] Alexander Technol Educ Inst, Dept Agr Technol, Thessaloniki 57400, Greece; [Abas, Z.] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Agr Dev, Orestiada 68200, Greece","Ragkos, A (corresponding author), Alexander Technol Educ Inst, Dept Agr Technol, Thessaloniki 57400, Greece.",ragkosagrecon@mail.com,,,,,,41,9,10,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1751-7311,1751-732X,,ANIMAL,Animal,FEB,2015,9,2,,,,,208,217,,10.1017/S1751731114002353,,,10,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences",Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences,AZ8XM,WOS:000348495100002,25245334,Other Gold,,,2021-07-05,

Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of two focus group sessions, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to a representative sample of 2,147 Norwegian households via e-mail. Findings - Results showed that the Norwegian public is concerned about fish welfare and is willing to pay a price premium for products made from welfare-assured fish. Norwegian consumers do not, however, want to be the only ones paying for fish welfare, as the main responsibility for fish welfare lies with producers and the Government. Research limitations/implications - In this study willingness to pay is measured using a hypothetical choice experiment. Values people express as citizens, however, may not accurately predict true consumer behaviour. This is generally referred to as citizen-consumer duality and may have affected the results. Practical implications - The study shows that there is a national market for welfare-assured fish products, but education initiatives focusing on fish farming and fish welfare issues would further influence the attitudes and purchasing habits of Norwegian consumers. Originality/value - Although concern about animal welfare is growing in the western world, very little attention has been given to the welfare of fish. This paper aims to make up for this by presenting a study of how Norwegians view the welfare of farmed salmon.","[Ellingsen, Kristian; Mejdell, Cecilie] Norwegian Vet Inst, Dept Hlth Surveillance, Oslo, Norway; [Grimsrud, Kristine] Stat Norway, Grp Energy & Environm Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Nielsen, Hanne Marie; Olesen, Ingrid] Nofima, Dept Breeding & Genet, As, Norway; [Honkanen, Pirjo] Nofima, Dept Consumer & Mkt Res, Tromso, Norway; [Navrud, Stale] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway; [Gamborg, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sandoe, Peter] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ Large Anim Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark","Ellingsen, K (corresponding author), Norwegian Vet Inst, Dept Hlth Surveillance, Oslo, Norway.",Kristian.Ellingsen@vetinst.no,"Gamborg, Christian/L-7392-2014; Marie, Mejdell Cecilie/K-2171-2012; Grimsrud, Kristine/G-5582-2019; Gamborg, Christian/AAC-2075-2019; Sandoe, Peter/E-8758-2015","Gamborg, Christian/0000-0003-3150-8280; Gamborg, Christian/0000-0003-3150-8280; Sandoe, Peter/0000-0003-0397-3273; Mejdell, Cecilie Marie/0000-0002-1260-8502; Ellingsen-Dalskau, Kristian/0000-0003-1290-2485",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [190457/S40],"The authors thank Ann-Charlotte Karlsson for help with conducting the focus group studies, Morten Raun Morkbak for useful advice concerning the discussion of hypothetical bias when interpreting WTP and an anonymous referee for useful comments.

We randomly assigned participants to one of five price treatments (either 2.5 or 5% above or below their reported expected price, or no change). We provide a simple empirical model to derive testable implications under prospect theory and use the internet survey to test them. Results indicate that among the respondents who faced prices below their expected price, only 12% chose to search, whereas 45% searched when prices were above. Further, we find results consistent with asymmetric search being driven by prospect theory. The change in consumers' willingness to search is twice as large when prices exceed expectations by 2.5% relative to when prices exceed them by 5% suggesting that consumers derive utility of finding a good deal evaluated relative to a reference price.

The results of genetic tests oftentimes may not lead to well-defined clinical interventions; however, Lynch syndrome, a genetic mutation for which carriers are at an increased risk for colorectal cancer, can be identified through genetic testing, and meaningful health interventions are available via increased colonoscopic surveillance. Valuations of test information for such conditions ought to account for the full impact of interventions and contingent outcomes. Objectives: To conduct a discrete-choice experiment to elicit individuals' preferences for genetic test information. Methods: A Web-enabled discrete-choice experiment survey was administered to a representative sample of US residents aged SO years and older. In addition to specifying expenditures on colonoscopies, respondents were asked to make a series of nine selections between two hypothetical genetic tests or a no test option under the premise that a relative had Lynch syndrome. The hypothetical genetic tests were defined by the probability of developing colorectal cancer, the probability of a false-negative test result, privacy of the result, and out-of-pocket cost A model specification identifying necessary interactions was derived from assumptions of risk behavior and the decision context and was estimated using random-parameters logit. Results: A total of 650 respondents were contacted, and 385 completed the survey. The monetary equivalent of test information was approximately $1800. Expenditures on colonoscopies to reduce mortality risks affected valuations. Respondents with lower income or who reported being employed significantly valued genetic tests more. Conclusion: Genetic testing may confer benefits through the impact of subsequent interventions on private individuals.","[Kilambi, Vikram] Northwestern Univ, Ctr Engn & Hlth, Evanston, IL USA; [Johnson, F.

PRET (Preparatory study for the Re-valuation of the EQ-5D Tariff project) contributes towards the methodology for its revaluation. Methods: Stage 1 examined key assumptions typically involved in health-state valuations through a series of binary choice exercises, namely that health-state preferences are independent of (1) duration of the state; (2) whose health it is (i.e. perspective); (3) length of 'lead time' (a mechanism to value all states on the same scale, including those who are worse than being dead); (4) when health events take place (time preference); and (5) satisfaction associated with the state. Further topics addressed were (6) exhaustion of lead time in the worst state; (7) health-state valuation using discrete choice experiments (DCEs) with a duration attribute; and (8) binary choice administration of lead time - time trade-off (LT-TTO). Stage 1 consisted of an online survey with 6000 respondents. Stage 2 compared the results above to those of an identical survey conducted in 200 face-to-face computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPIs), covering topics (1) to (7). Stages 3 and 4 examined - in more detail and depth - issues taken from stage 1. Stage 3 consisted of CAPI surveys of a representative UK sample of 300, using examples of TTO, LT-TTO, and DCE with duration, each followed by extensive feedback questions. Stage 4 was a more intensive exercise involving a qualitative analysis of people's thought processes during both binary choice and iterative health-state valuation exercises. Data were collected through 'think-aloud' methods in 30 interviews of a convenience sample. Results: Stage 1 found that health-state values are not independent of (1) duration of the state but there is no clear pattern; (2) whose health it is; (3) the duration of 'lead time' but there was no clear pattern; (4) when health events take place; or (5) satisfaction associated with the state. Furthermore, (6) exhaustion of lead time in the worst state was subject to substantial framing effects; (7) the five-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) can be valued using DCE with duration as an attribute; and (8) binary choice LT-TTO can be administered in an online environment. Stage 2 found that although online surveys and CAPI surveys resulted in different compositions of respondents, at the aggregate, their responses to the experimental questions covering (1) to (7) above were not statistically significantly different from each other. Stages 3 and 4 found that TTO and LT-TTO were easier than DCE with duration; respondents did not necessarily trade across all attributes of EQ-5D; some respondents found it difficult to distinguish between the two worst levels of EQ-5D-5L, and some respondents may be thinking about the impact of their ill health on their family. Conclusions: In order for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to make the most appropriate decisions, the EQ-5D tariff needs to incorporate the latest understanding of health-state preferences. PRET contributed to the knowledge base on the conduct of health-state valuation studies.","[Mulhern, Brendan; Brazier, John; Rowen, Donna; Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Bansback, Nick] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Cairns, John] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1, England; [Devlin, Nancy] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Dolan, Paul; Kavetsos, Georgios] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Hole, Arne Risa; Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, London, England","Tsuchiya, A (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Devlin, Nancy/M-3816-2014; Cairns, John/AAD-1168-2020","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109; Hole, Arne Risa/0000-0002-9413-8101; Bansback, Nick/0000-0002-1510-3462",Medical Research Council (MRC)-National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [G0901500]; EuroQol Group; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [G0901500] Funding Source: researchfish,"The Medical Research Council (MRC)-National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Methodology Research Programme funded the PRET project (MRC ref.

This study applies a generalized multinomial logit model to interpret the results of a discrete choice experiment administered to a representative sample of 1001 Poles. The questionnaire included three physical attributes: protecting the most ecologically valuable forest ecosystems, reducing litter in forests, and improving recreation infrastructure. The selection of these attributes was motivated by extensive qualitative research regarding to what indicators of biodiversity, nature protection and recreation possibilities people are most sensitive. The fourth attribute was monetary, that is, additional costs associated with the new programs that would have to be financed out of increased taxes. The results allowed for an estimation of implicit prices regarding the choice attributes and calculating welfare measures of specific forest management scenarios. The study revealed interesting connections between respondents' current forest recreation patterns and the importance they place on the various attributes of forests. The paper particularly focuses on respondents' unobserved and observed preference heterogeneity, as well as scale heterogeneity, and the study demonstrates how heterogeneity can improve the models and provide insight into how users and non-users of forests may benefit from introducing a particular policy.

It is based on the analysis of the most relevant types of PA (national park, nature park, biosphere reserve), constituting part of the supply of tourism development, and a representative survey of the German population interested in holidays in the alpine area, representing the demand. Our analysis of the legal framework showed that all three types of PA facilitate tourism development, albeit in different ways. The survey included a generic choice experiment of alpine destinations with 17 attributes. Its location in or close to a PA was included as one variable. This destination demand study in an area of origin provided a different perspective on the preference for PA compared to other studies, and revealed significant differences between respondents with and without previous experiences in the Alps. The alpine experienced tourist is more likely to distinguish between the various types of PA such as national park and nature park. For the inexperienced alpine tourist, representing latent demand, the branding effect of PA is rather limited. For nearly all tourists, experienced and inexperienced, and across all segments, offers that include a nature experience are important. Nature experience, which is offered by all types of PA, is of high relevance within the destination choice and should therefore be used more intensely in destination marketing based on PA. Overall, this study shows that the role of PA for destination choice is not as strong as is reported by most of the published literature, as most of these studies are based on surveys in the destination and use single item scaling questions, which overvalue the role of PA.","[Proebstl-Haider, Ulrike] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Agr Univ Vienna, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Haider, Wolfgang] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Ctr Tourism Policy & Res, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Probstl-Haider, U (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Agr Univ Vienna, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",ulrike.proebstl@boku.ac.at; whaider@sfu.ca,,,,,,99,8,8,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

This study estimates the effectiveness of risk communication frames and insurance policy conditions in increasing demand for flood insurance. It is examined how communication interacts with individual frames about the flood hazard that are rooted in regulatory focus theory. A choice experiment elicits willingness-to-pay (WTP) for annual and multi-year flood insurance, using of a survey of a representative sample of 1250 households. The statistical method is a mixed logit model that accounts for heteroskedasticity arising from stated choice certainty. The communication frames considerably increase WTP compared with a control group. This effect of communication is positively related to an individual's degree of prevention motivation. Moreover, we find that demand for flood insurance can be increased by introducing multi-year policies, as long as the contract duration is not too long. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluations of migraineurs' productivity losses and health-related quality of life have provided an understanding of the burden associated with the headache and post-headache symptoms, but do not quantify the relative importance of each phase from a patient perspective. In this study, we evaluated migraineurs' willingness to accept trade-offs among symptom severity in the headache and post-headache phases, symptom duration in the headache and post-headache phases, and symptom-free time within a general-preference theoretic framework. MethodsWe administered a choice-format, conjoint-analysis survey, also called a discrete-choice experiment, to a sample of migraineurs from a nationally representative online consumer panel. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 510 eligible subjects completed the survey. The survey elicited choices between pairs of migraine profiles describing symptom durations and symptom-free time for the headache and post-headache phase. ResultsMigraineurs in our study were strongly affected by the pain associated with the headache phase. However, experiencing difficulty with daily social and family activities in the post-headache phase also had a statistically significant impact on migraineurs' perceived level of well-being. Migraineurs reported that hypothetical treatments that limited the duration of headache symptoms without allowing them to resume their daily activities for 16 hours after a headache, on average, were less than half as good as treatments that limited both headache and post-headache symptoms. ConclusionOur results suggest that treatments that relieve and shorten symptoms during the post-headache phase can offer significant benefits to migraineurs.","[Gonzalez, Juan M.; Johnson, F.

Sedentary living and high fat diets contribute to the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. This paper analyses the trade-offs between lifestyle choices defined in terms of diet, physical activity, cost, and risk of cardiovascular disease that a representative sample of the population of Northern Ireland aged 40-65 are willing to make. Using computer assisted personal interviews, we survey 493 individuals at their homes using a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) questionnaire administered between February and July 2011 in Northern Ireland. Unlike most DCE studies for valuing public health programmes, this questionnaire uses a tailored exercise, based on the individuals' baseline choices. A fat screener module in the questionnaire links personal cardiovascular disease risk to each specific choice set in terms of dietary constituents. Individuals are informed about their real status quo risk of a fatal cardiovascular event, based on an initial set of health questions. Thus, actual risks, real diet and exercise choices are the elements that constitute the choice task. Our results show that our respondents are willing to pay for reducing mortality risk and, more importantly, are willing to change physical exercise and dietary behaviours. In particular, we find that to improve their lifestyles, overweight and obese people would be more likely to do more physical activity than to change their diets. Therefore, public policies aimed to target obesity and its related illnesses in Northern Ireland should invest public money in promoting physical activity rather than healthier diets.

The main aim of this study was to better understand and determine breast and colorectal cancer patients' decision-making strategies and the trade-offs they make in deciding about characteristics of molecular genomic diagnostics for breast and colorectal cancer. Patients & methods: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 300 breast and colorectal cancer patients using a previously developed web-administered instrument. Eligibility criteria included patients aged 18 years and older with either breast or colorectal cancer. We explored several attributes and attribute levels of molecular genomic diagnostics in 20 scenarios. Results: Our ana-lysis revealed that both breast and colorectal cancer patients weighted the capability of molecular genomic diagnostics to determine the probability of treatment efficacy as being of greater importance than information provided to detect adverse events. The probability of either false-positive or -negative results was ranked highly as a potential barrier by both breast and colorectal patients. However, 78.6% of breast cancer patients ranked the possibility of a 'false-negative test result leading to undertreatment' higher than the 'chance of a false positive, which may lead to overtreatment' (68%). This finding contrasted with the views of colorectal cancer patients who ranked the chance of a false positive as being of greater concern than a false negative (72.8 vs 63%). Overall, cancer patients exhibited a high willingness to accept and pay for genomic diagnostic tests, especially among breast cancer patients. Cancer patients seek a test accuracy rate of 90% or higher. Breast and colorectal cancer patients' decisions about genomic diagnostics are influenced more by the probability of being cured than by avoiding potential severe adverse events. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the relative weight that breast and colorectal cancer patients place on various aspects of molecular genomic diagnostics, and the trade-offs they are willing to make among attributes of such tests.","[Issa, Amalia M.; Tufail, Waqas; Atehortua, Nelson] Univ Sci, Program Personalized Med & Targeted Therapeut, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Issa, Amalia M.] Univ Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Publ Hlth, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Issa, Amalia M.] Univ Houston, Coll Pharm, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Issa, Amalia M.] Methodist Hosp, Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [McKeever, John] Gelb Consulting Grp Inc, Houston, TX USA","Issa, AM (corresponding author), Univ Sci, Program Personalized Med & Targeted Therapeut, Philadelphia, PA USA.",a.issa@usciences.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U54-CA113007, R01-CA138599]; Uniting Against Lung Cancer [13020513]",This work was supported by NIH grants U54-CA113007 and R01-CA138599 and Uniting Against Lung Cancer grant 13020513.

A Choice Experiment,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HEALTH RESEARCH; UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS; SCIENCE; IMPACT; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES,"Purpose To quantify and compare the preferences of researchers and laypeople in Canada regarding the outcomes of basic biomedical research. Method In autumn 2010, the authors conducted a cross-sectional, national survey of basic biomedical researchers funded by Canada's national health research agency and a representative sample of Canadian citizens to assess preferences for research outcomes across five attributes using a discrete choice experiment. Attributes included advancing scientific knowledge (assessed by published papers); building research capacity (assessed by trainees); informing decisions in the health products industry (assessed by patents); targeting economic, health, or scientific priorities; and cost. The authors reduced a fractional factorial design (18 pairwise choices plus an opt-out option) to three blocks of six. They also computed part worth utilities, differences in predicted probabilities, and willingness-to-pay values using nested logit models. Results Of 3,260 potential researchers, 1,749 (53.65% response rate) completed the questionnaire, along with 1,002 citizens. Researchers and citizens prioritized high-quality scientific outcomes (papers, trainees) over other attributes. Both groups disvalued research targeted at economic priorities relative to health priorities. Researchers granted a premium to proposals targeting scientific priorities. Conclusions Citizens and researchers fundamentally prioritized the same outcomes for basic biomedical research. Notably, they prioritized traditional scientific outcomes and disvalued the pursuit of economic returns. These findings have implications for how academic medicine assigns incentives and value to basic health research and how biomedical researchers and the public may jointly contribute to setting the future research agenda.","[Miller, Fiona A.; Axler, Renata; Wodchis, Walter P.; Bytautas, Jessica P.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada; [Mentzakis, Emmanouil] Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Div, Southampton, Hants, England; [Lehoux, Pascale] Univ Montreal, Dept Hlth Adm, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lehoux, Pascale] Univ Montreal, Publ Hlth Res Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [French, Martin] NYU, Dept Media Culture & Commun, New York, NY USA; [Tarride, Jean-Eric] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Wilson, Brenda J.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Longo, Christopher] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada","Miller, FA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, 155 Coll St,4th Floor, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada.",fiona.miller@utoronto.ca,"Bytautas, Jessica P/F-3066-2016; Lehoux, Pascale/M-9363-2013; Lehoux, Pascale/Q-6370-2019; Greiver, Michelle/N-8764-2015","Bytautas, Jessica P/0000-0002-7931-2036; Lehoux, Pascale/0000-0001-9482-1800; Lehoux, Pascale/0000-0001-9482-1800; Greiver, Michelle/0000-0001-8957-0285; wodchis, walter/0000-0003-2494-7031; Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4953-6255; Mentzakis, Emmanouil/0000-0003-1761-209X",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (FRN)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [81195],This research was funded through an investigator-initiated grant (F.A.M.) from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (FRN no. 81195).,,43,10,10,0,21,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1040-2446,1938-808X,,ACAD MED,Acad.

Current breeding programs typically focus on profitability through emphasizing fast growth of the fish. This research, however, finds that a representative sample of Norwegian households are willing to pay an increased tax for farmed Atlantic salmon that is selected for traits related to fish welfare. In an Internet survey, a random and representative sample of Norwegian households were asked to choose among breeding programs for farmed Atlantic salmon that differed with regards to costs and the following four traits related to fish welfare; frequency of deformities (Deform), frequencies of injuries (Injur), resistance to Salmon Lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) (Lice) and resistance to diseases (Health). The survey participants were given six different choice sets, and in each they chose one of three alternative salmon breeding programs. Two of the alternative breeding programs would give improvements in at least one of the trait attributes and would result in an earmarked tax per household per year. The third alternative was the status quo option, i.e. a zero earmarked tax with focus only on growth enhancing traits and profitability in breeding programs. Based on the estimation results of random parameter logit models mean willingness to pay (WTP) was estimated for all households and for the subsample of households purchasing farmed salmon. The average WTP was higher for the subsample that purchases farmed salmon compared to the full sample. For households that purchase farmed salmon, the average WTP in terms of an earmarked tax for all attributes were significant and highest for Lice (1034 NOK/yr), followed by Health (749 NOK/yr). The WTP for Deform (282 NOK/yr) and Injur (256 NOK) were nearly the same. For the full sample of household, the average WTP was significantly different from zero at the 5% level only for Health (613.1 NOK/yr) and Lice (951.2 NOK/yr). This study provides evidence that there is a high WTP among all Norwegian households to improve the welfare of farmed Atlantic salmon through increased resistance to diseases and Salmon Lice, which may imply less use of medicines and chemicals in the production process. Only households that purchase farmed salmon are willing to pay an earmarked tax to reduce deformities and injuries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.","[Nielsen, H.

The aim of this paper is to assess the role the country of origin plays in the preferences of German consumers for peaches. Since German legislation requires fresh fruit sold on the market to clearly display the products country of origin, German consumers usually make their choice with this information at hand. We attempted to investigate such concerns through a choice experiment approach conducted by means of a questionnaire-based survey administered to a representative sample of 300 German households. In the experiment, respondents were asked to choose their favorite peach among four alternatives. Each peach was described as imported from four specific countries (Italy, Spain, Turkey and France) and available at 0 specific price: some of the peaches were certified as Organic or PDO. The stated choices are analyzed using a latent class choice model to derive estimates of preferences for peaches. Results indicate the presence of three distinct consumer segments in the German peach market. The hugest segment (48%) showed a strong preference for Italian peaches as well as for organic and PDO certification. For this segment. price was not an important attribute. The second segment (41%) showed a strong preference for Spanish produce and organic certification. Price was important in this case. The third segment (11%) had a negative preference for Italian and Spanish peaches, with price being the main attribute.","[Cicia, Gianni; Cembalo, Luigi; Del Giudice, Teresa] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Econ & Polit Agr, Naples, Italy","Cicia, G (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Econ & Polit Agr, Naples, Italy.",,,"Cembalo, Luigi/0000-0002-3808-5797; Del Giudice, Teresa/0000-0001-9417-7816; Cicia, Gianni/0000-0003-4188-241X",MiPAAF (Italian Ministry for Agricultural and Forestry Policy),"Research financed by the MiPAAF (Italian Ministry for Agricultural and Forestry Policy), QUAGRI Project.",,14,5,5,0,4,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2012,11,3,,,,,75,79,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Agriculture,046MO,WOS:000311769300009,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-07-05,

Given the obstacles to ensuring sustainable improvements in water supply infrastructure and the unhygienic handling of water after collection, household water treatment and storage (HWTS) products have been viewed as important mechanisms for increasing access to safe water. Although studies have shown that HWTS technologies can reduce the likelihood of diarrheal illness by about 30%, levels of adoption and continued use remain low. An understanding of household preferences for HWTS products can be used to create demand through effective product positioning and social marketing, and ultimately improve and ensure commercial sustainability and scalability of these products. However, there has been little systematic research on consumer preferences for HWTS products. This paper reports the results of the first state-of-the-art conjoint analysis study of HWTS products. In 2008, we conducted a conjoint analysis survey of a representative sample of households in Andhra Pradesh (AP), India to elicit and quantify household preferences for commercial HWTS products. Controlling for attribute non-attendance in an error components mixed logit model, the study results indicate that the most important features to respondents, in terms of the effect on utility, were the type of product, followed by the extent to which the product removes pathogens, the retail outlet and, the time required to treat 10 L Holding all other product attributes constant, filters were preferred to combination products and chemical additives. Department stores and weekly markets were the most favorable sales outlets, followed by mobile salespeople. In general, households do not prefer to purchase HWTS products at local shops. Our results can inform the types of products and sales outlets that are likely to be successful in commercial HWTS markets in AP, as well as the influence of different pricing and financing strategies on product demand and uptake.

With the combination of worsening economic conditions, an aging population and reductions in tax revenues, the pressures to make structural changes are expected to continue growing. Common cost control mechanisms, e. g. curtailment of patient access and treatment prioritization, are likely to be adversely viewed by citizens. It seems therefore wise to include them in the decision making processes that lead up to policy changes. In the context of a multilevel iterative mixed-method design a quantitative survey representative of the German population (N = 2031) was conducted to probe the acceptance of priority setting in medicine and to explore the practicability of direct public involvement. Here we focus on preferences for patients' characteristics (medical aspects, lifestyle and socio-economic status) as possible criteria for prioritizing medical services. A questionnaire with closed response options was fielded to gain insight into attitudes toward broad prioritization criteria of patient groups. Furthermore, a discrete choice experiment was used as a rigorous approach to investigate citizens' preferences toward specific criteria level in context of other criteria. Both the questionnaire and the discrete choice experiment were performed with the same sample. The citizens' own health and social situation are included as explanatory variables. Data were evaluated using corresponding analysis, contingency analysis, logistic regression and a multinomial exploded logit model. The results show that some medical criteria are highly accepted for prioritizing patients whereas socio-economic criteria are rejected.","[Diederich, Adele] Jacobs Univ, Bremen, Germany; [Swait, Joffre] Univ Technol, Ctr Study Choice, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wirsik, Norman] BIPS Inst Epidemiol & Prevent Res, Bremen, Germany","Diederich, A (corresponding author), Jacobs Univ, Bremen, Germany.",a.diederich@jacobs-university.de,"Swait, Joffre D/F-7236-2014","Swait, Joffre D/0000-0002-0435-117X; Wirsik, Norman/0000-0002-4799-4722",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [DGF Di506/10-1],"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Grant number: DGF Di506/10-1.

Subjects included individuals with a self-reported diagnosis of plaque psoriasis from a nationally representative US household panel. Subjects completed a web-based conjoint analysis survey and chose between hypothetical treatments in a series of questions. Each alternative was defined by lesion severity, percentage of body surface area (BSA) covered by lesions, type of treatment, injection discomfort or pain (if treatment included injections), risk of serious lung infection, and monthly out-of-pocket cost. 28,200 panelists were invited to participate. 18,330 responded, 503 qualified, and 419 completed the survey. Mean age was 54.5 years and 52% were female. 64% (35%) of patients reported psoriasis severity as mild or mild to moderate (moderate to very severe). Patients were willing to pay $486.73 out-of-pocket per month to eliminate severe lesions covering 25% BSA on the arms and legs and $444.80 out-of-pocket per month to eliminate moderate lesions covering 4% BSA on the face.

The influence of more than one agent has been recognised for many years, and yet the majority of automobile choice studies develop choice models as if a single agent is involved in the preference revelation process. What is not clear is whether it makes any substantive difference in preference revelation according to who is interviewed in a household. Using a generalised mixed logit framework that accounts for preference and scale heterogeneity, we estimate a series of models to investigate whether there are significant differences between the preferences of each individual in a household when assessed in isolation from other household members, as well as their joint preferences when expressing their preferences through a group choice task. The context is choosing amongst petrol, diesel and hybrid fuelled vehicles (associated with specific levels of fuel efficiency and engine capacity) when faced with a mix of vehicle prices, fuel prices, fixed annual registration fees, annual emission surcharges and vehicle kilometre emission surcharges. Using a stated choice experiment, we find that sampling a single individual as a representative of the household's preferences is less appropriate than utilising preference information from the relevant group of decision makers in the household.","[Hensher, David A.; Beck, Matthew J.; Rose, John M.] Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Hensher, DA (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",David.Hensher@sydney.edu.au; Matthew.Beck@sydney.edu.au; John.Rose@sydney.edu.au,"Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021","Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980; Beck, Matthew/0000-0003-1111-2852; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,28,23,23,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Little is known about consumer sensitivity to different channeling incentives. In particular, the impact of status quo bias, which is expected to differ between different provider types, can play a large role in insurers' channeling ability. Objective To examine consumer sensitivity to channeling strategies and to analyze the impact of status quo bias for different provider types. Data Sources/Study Design With a large-scale discrete choice experiment, we investigate the impact of channeling incentives on choices for pharmacies and general practitioners (GPs). Survey data were obtained among a representative Dutch household panel (n=2,500). Principal Findings Negative financial incentives have a two to three times larger impact on provider choice than positive ones. Positive financial incentives have a relatively small impact on GP choice, while the impact of qualitative incentives is relatively large. Status quo bias has a large impact on provider choice, which is more prominent in the case of GPs than in the case of pharmacies. Conclusion The large impact of the status quo bias makes channeling consumers away from their current providers a daunting task, particularly in the case of GPs.","[Boonen, Lieke H. H.

A representative sample of 1435 respondents from the Danish population answered the discrete choice experiment in a web-based questionnaire with a random split including/excluding the cost attribute. The two groups were asked to make both forced and unforced choices in each choice set. Our results show that in the unforced choice utility and scale parameters were not affected and the rank order remained the same when a cost attribute was included. In the forced choice the test of equal utility parameters was rejected, and rank order, marginal rates of substitution, and variance was shown to differ between the two groups.

Our objective is to assess preferences for publicly funded health policies designed to prevent or treat major health threats. We use national surveys that employ discrete choice experiment formats. The surveys allow respondents to make trade-offs between policies designed to prevent or treat most major health threats. The surveys were administered to a nationally representative sample of over 3000 respondents. Methods. We estimate a random utility model of preferences for treatment and prevention policies and explore sources of systematic heterogeneity in preferences. Results. We estimate marginal utility associated with avoided deaths to be about twice as high for prevention policies as for treatment policies and find statistically significant heterogeneity with respect to disease type, the group targeted by the policy, and respondent characteristics. Conclusions. Preferences for public health policies vary markedly with policy attributes and with individual characteristics. Benefits measurements for welfare assessments of public health policies should be tailored to the type of health threat and the characteristics of the affected population.","[Bosworth, Ryan] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Cameron, Trudy Ann] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [DeShazo, J.

Target group segmentation: an empirical analysis,ZUCHTUNGSKUNDE,,,German,Article,,,,,,Equestrian sports; target groups; breeding objectives; cluster analysis,,"In this case study 135 horse riders were asked for their preferences when it comes to horse purchasing. By using a factor and a cluster analysis we developed a typology of riders in order to reveal differences in preferences between these groups. The four identified clusters can be divided into the following categories: leisure riders, visually orientated riders, breeding and performance orientated riders and lastly ambitious tournament leisure riders. The leisure riders are not interested in the characteristics of horse origin or breeding values, while the breeding and benefit orientated on the contrary are very interested in these items. The results show that three out of four identified groups are leisure orientated. Furthermore there is a growing number of leisure riders with a low level of breeding and horsemanship knowledge. The character/temperament of a horse was thus identified as being of utmost importance in the three leisure orientated groups. Consequently the character/temperament as a quality criterion of leisure horses should be taken into account to a greater extent in breeding and marketing. Differences concerning the willingness to pay could not be found between the individual groups. It should be noted that the survey cannot be considered representative due to the small sample size. In further research the sample should be increased. The purchase decision and willingness to pay should be investigated in a choice experiment by means of a discrete choice analysis.","[Gille, Claudia; Spiller, A.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Gille, C (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cgille@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,23,6,6,1,6,EUGEN ULMER GMBH CO,STUTTGART,"POSTFACH 700561 WOLLGRASWEG 41, D-70599 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0044-5401,,,ZUCHTUNGSKUNDE,Zuchtungskunde,MAY-JUN,2010,82,3,,,,,229,240,,,,,12,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science",Agriculture,596OY,WOS:000277695800006,,,,,2021-07-05,

The implementation of mass colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is a public health priority. Population participation is fundamental for the success of CRC screening as for any cancer screening program. The preferences of the population may influence their likelihood of participation. Objectives. The authors sought to elicit population preferences for CRC screening test characteristics to improve the design of CRC screening campaigns. Methods. A discrete choice experiment was used. Questionnaires were compiled with a set of pairs of hypothetical CRC screening scenarios. The survey was conducted by mail from June 2006 to October 2006 on a representative sample of 2000 inhabitants, aged 50 to 74 years from the northwest of France, who were randomly selected from electoral lists. Questionnaires were sent to 2000 individuals, each of whom made 3 or 4 discrete choices between hypothetical tests that differed in 7 attributes: how screening is offered, process, sensitivity, rate of unnecessary colonoscopy, expected mortality reduction, method of screening test result transmission, and cost. Results. Complete responses were received from 656 individuals (32.8%). The attributes that influenced population preferences included expected mortality reduction, sensitivity, cost, and process. Participants from high social classes were particularly influenced by sensitivity. Conclusions. The results demonstrate that the discrete choice experiment provides information on patient preferences for CRC screening: improving screening program effectiveness, for instance, by improving test sensitivity (the most valued attribute) would increase satisfaction among the general population with regard to CRC screening programs. Additional studies are required to study how patient preferences actually affect adherence to regular screening programs.","[Launoy, Guy] CHU Caen, INSERM, EA UCBN Canc & Populat 3936, UF Evaluat & Rech Epidemiol,ERI 3, F-14000 Caen, France; [Nayaradou, Maximilien] Univ Paris, Inst Finance Dauphine, Dauphine, France","Launoy, G (corresponding author), CHU Caen, INSERM, EA UCBN Canc & Populat 3936, UF Evaluat & Rech Epidemiol,ERI 3, F-14000 Caen, France.",guy.launoy@unicaen.fr,"BERCHI, Celia/L-7238-2015; dejardin, olivier/L-9879-2015; Launoy, Guy/K-7372-2015","dejardin, olivier/0000-0002-6561-1430; BERCHI, Celia/0000-0002-3091-8539",National Cancer InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI); Ligue Nationale contre le cancerLigue nationale contre le cancer,"This study was funded by the National Cancer Institute and the Ligue Nationale contre le cancer.''

The Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) study investigates workforce participation patterns and their determinants using a longitudinal survey of Australian doctors. It aims to generate evidence to support developing effective policy responses to workforce issues such as shortages and maldistribution. This paper describes the study protocol and baseline cohort, including an analysis of response rates and response bias. Methods/Design: MABEL is a prospective cohort study. All Australian doctors undertaking clinical work in 2008 (n = 54,750) were invited to participate, and annual waves of data collections will be undertaken until at least 2011. Data are collected by paper or optional online version of a questionnaire, with content tailored to four sub-groups of clinicians: general practitioners, specialists, specialists in training, and hospital non-specialists. In the baseline wave, data were collected on: job satisfaction, attitudes to work and intentions to quit or change hours worked; a discrete choice experiment examining preferences and trade-offs for different types of jobs; work setting; workload; finances; geographic location; demographics; and family circumstances. Discussion: The baseline cohort includes 10,498 Australian doctors, representing an overall response rate of 19.36%. This includes 3,906 general practitioners, 4,596 specialists, 1,072 specialists in training, and 924 hospital non-specialists. Respondents were more likely to be younger, female, and to come from non-metropolitan areas, the latter partly reflecting the effect of a financial incentive on response for doctors in remote and rural areas. Specialists and specialists in training were more likely to respond, whilst hospital non-specialists were less likely to respond. The distribution of hours worked was similar between respondents and data from national medical labour force statistics. The MABEL survey provides a large, representative cohort of Australian doctors. It enables investigation of the determinants of doctors' decisions about how much, where and in what circumstances they practice, and of changes in these over time. MABEL is intended to provide an important resource for policy makers and other stakeholders in the Australian medical workforce.","[Joyce, Catherine M.] Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Alfred Hosp, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Scott, Anthony; Jeon, Sung-Hee; Kalb, Guyonne; Leahy, Anne] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Humphreys, John] Monash Univ, Sch Rural Hlth, Bendigo, Vic 3552, Australia; [Witt, Julia] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada","Joyce, CM (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Alfred Hosp, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",catherine.joyce@med.monash.edu.au,"Kalb, Guyonne/H-7383-2015; Scott, Anthony/E-6636-2010","Kalb, Guyonne/0000-0001-6582-8608; Scott, Anthony/0000-0002-2851-5378",National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research [454799]; Commonwealth Department of Health and AgeingAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Health & Ageing,"This work was supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Grant (454799) and the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing.

However, empirical data on the actual economic appreciation of local mitigation and adaptation measures expressed as citizen willingness-to-pay (WTP) are scarce. In this paper, we report results of a preference survey using a choice experiment (CE) that quantifies economic preferences for biodiversity-based climate change mitigation and adaptation in the region surrounding Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany). A representative sample of 302 respondents-the majority of them frequent Hainich forest visitors-was interviewed in autumn 2006. Nested logit analysis showed that respondents state a substantially positive WTP for climate change mitigation by afforestation (p < 0.001). If converted to WTP for an additional sequestration of carbon that average German citizens emit as CO2, a monetary value of 7.34 (sic) yr(-1) t C-1 is obtained. For increasing forest resistance and resilience against insect pests and storms (climate change adaptation) a WTP of 27.54 (sic) yr(-1) (p < 0.001) is obtained, and 16.83 (sic) yr(-1) (p < 0.001) is obtained for increasing the general resilience and resistance of forest ecosystems to environmental stressors. Respondents support moderate programs to eradicate invasive plants when compared to more aggressive eradication measures. Due to the lack of comparable studies, it can only be conservatively assumed that WTP would be lower if mitigation and adaptation measures were to be implemented in forests not, or only rarely, used by respondents. As all proposed means for climate change mitigation and adaptation contribute to local forest ecosystem biodiversity, the results of the study advocate the realization of measures that potentially benefit both climate policy and regional conservation concerns,","[Rajmis, Sandra; Barkmann, Jan; Marggraf, Rainer] Univ Gottingen, Inst Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-57073 Gottingen, Germany","Rajmis, S (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Inst Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-57073 Gottingen, Germany.",srajmis@uni-goettingen.de,"Barkmann, Jan/B-7928-2014","Barkmann, Jan/0000-0001-7751-3435",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG Graduiertenkolleg)German Research Foundation (DFG) [1086],"We thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG Graduiertenkolleg 1086) for funding, our research assistants, the survey participants, Hainich area respondents for collaboration-especially M.

Both elements risk burdening the population with a welfare loss if preferences for risk and insurance attributes differ. This suggests the introduction of more choice in social health insurance packages may be advantageous; however, it is widely believed that this would not benefit the elderly. Objective: To examine the relationship between age and willingness to pay (WTP) for additional options in Swiss social health insurance. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was developed using six attributes (deductibles, co-payment, access to alternative medicines, medication choice, access to innovation, and monthly premium) that are currently in debate within the context of Swiss health insurance. These attributes have been shown to be important in the choice of insurance contract. Using statistical design optimization procedures, the number of choice sets was reduced to 27 and randomly split into three groups. One choice was included twice to test for consistency. Two random effects probit models were developed: a simple model where marginal utilities and WTP values were not allowed to vary according to socioeconomic characteristics, and a more complex model where the values were permitted to depend on socioeconomic variables. A representative telephone survey of 1000 people aged >24 years living in the German-and French-speaking parts of Switzerland was conducted. Participants were asked to compare the status quo (i.e. their current insurance contract) with ten hypothetical alternatives. In addition, participants were asked questions concerning utilization of healthcare services; overall satisfaction with the healthcare system, insurer and insurance policy; and a general preference for new elements in the insurance package. Socioeconomic variables surveyed were age, sex, total household income, education (seven categories ranging from primary school to university degree), place of residence, occupation, and marital status. Results: All chosen elements proved relevant for choice in the simple model. Accounting for socioeconomic characteristics in the comprehensive model reveals preference heterogeneity for contract attributes, but also for the propensity to consider deviating from the status quo and choosing an alternative health insurance contract. Conclusion: The findings suggest that while the elderly do exhibit a stronger status quo bias than younger age groups, they require less rather than more specific compensation for selected cutbacks, indicating a potential for contracts that induce self-rationing in return for lower premiums.","[Becker, Karolin] Plaut Econ, CH-4600 Olten, Switzerland; [Zweifel, Peter] Univ Zurich, Socioecon Inst, Zurich, Switzerland","Becker, K (corresponding author), Plaut Econ, Baslerstr 37, CH-4600 Olten, Switzerland.",karolin.becker@plaut.ch,,,,,,57,15,15,1,16,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1178-1653,1178-1661,,PATIENT,Patient,JAN 1,2008,1,1,,,,,27,40,,10.2165/01312067-200801010-00006,,,14,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Health Care Sciences & Services,V14TB,WOS:000207755600006,22272755,Green Accepted,,,2021-07-05,

However, little is known about potential patients' preferences for surgical care provision. The aim of this study was to investigate the general publics' preferences towards location and other attributes of surgical treatment. Methods An economic evaluation technique, discrete choice analysis, was administered in a survey to a sample of a German general public Internet panel, representative in terms of age, gender and education. Responders were asked to choose their preferred provider of surgical care in a series of pairwise choices, defined by five attributes. Regression analysis was used to quantify preferences towards characteristics of care and to calculate utilities of treatment scenarios. The strength of preferences and the rate at which participants were willing to trade among attributes were estimated. Results The response rate was 76% (n = 1134). 'Specialization and experience of provider' was the single most important attribute, followed by 'waiting times' and 'staff continuity'. Subjects traded a 4-week waiting time to obtain surgery at a highly specialized institution. Responders favoured outpatient clinics over office-based and inpatient surgery, but 'location of care' preferences were only weak. Whether participants had undergone surgery in the past had only minor effect on their preferences. Conclusions Potential patients base their choice between providers mainly on characteristics of care delivery and not location of care. The competition between and among providers of surgical care of different types of institutional organization will be determined by what is offered to patients.","Univ Witten Herdecke, Fac Med, D-58448 Witten, Germany","Schwappach, DLB (corresponding author), Univ Witten Herdecke, Fac Med, Alfred Herrhausen Str 50, D-58448 Witten, Germany.",Davids@uni-wh.de,"Schwappach, David L.B./L-8378-2018","Schwappach, David L.B./0000-0001-8668-3065",,,,21,18,18,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1356-1294,1365-2753,,J EVAL CLIN PRACT,J.

A discrete choice experiment postal survey conducted in three English general practitioner (GP) co-operatives. A total of 871 individuals aged 20-70 years registered with a GP. Outcomes were preferences for, and trade-offs between: time to making initial contact, time waiting for advice/treatment, informed of expected waiting time, type of contact, professional providing advice, chance contact relieves anxiety, and utility estimates for valuing current models of care. Response rate was 37%. Respondents valued out-of-hours contact for services for reducing anxiety but this was not the only attribute of importance. They had preferences for the way in which services were organized and valued information about expected waiting time, supporting findings from elsewhere. Participants were most willing to make trade-offs between waiting time and professional person. Of the predicted utility for three models of care utility was higher for fully integrated call management. Greater utility might be achieved if existing services are re-configured more in line with the government's fully integrated call management model. Because the attributes were described in generic terms, the findings can be applied more generally to the plethora of models that exist (and many that might exist in the future). The approach used is important for achieving greater public involvement in how health services develop. Few experiments have elicited public preferences for health services in the UK to date. This study showed valid preferences were expressed but there were problems obtaining representative views from the public.","Univ Southampton, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Sch Med, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Div Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Brighton, E Sussex, England","Gerard, K (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Nightingale Bldg,Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",kareng@soton.ac.uk,"Smith, Helen E/M-2449-2016","Smith, Helen E/0000-0003-1883-6124; Turnbull, Joanne/0000-0002-5006-4438",,,,22,18,18,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1369-6513,1369-7625,,HEALTH EXPECT,Health Expect.,MAR,2006,9,1,,,,,60,69,,10.1111/j.1369-7625.2006.00365.x,,,10,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",008KQ,WOS:000235040000007,16436162,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2021-07-05,
